187965065,"The sales of multimillion-pound properties hit a record high last year, even as
those down the ladder struggled to gain a foothold.

According to Lloyds TSB, 1,518 sales were worth at least 2 million, up from
1,442 in 2010. This is the highest number of sales in this bracket since records
began 17 years ago.

Sales of properties topping the 2 million mark were also 2 per cent higher last
year than at the peak of the housing market in 2007. More than three quarters of
all 2 million-plus sales in 2011 were in London, and more than half of all
multimillionpound sales took place in three boroughs: Kensington and Chelsea,
Westminster and Camden.

In addition, the number of properties selling for more than 5 million rose by
22 per cent, from 128 in 2010 to 156, providing further evidence of the strength
of sales at the top end of the market.

But despite the increase in sales, Lloyds estimates that only 0.2 per cent of
all homes in Britain are worth at least 2 million and, therefore, potentially
subject to the new7 per cent stamp duty rate. Even in London, multimillion-pound
sales account for only 1.3 per cent of all properties.

Suren Thiru, a Lloyds housing economist, said: ""The rise in the number of
multimillion-pound property sales over the past year compares to the weakening
picture across the rest of the market, highlighting the strength at the very top
end of the housing market.""

She believes that continuing demand from cash-rich buyers, from Britain and
overseas, as well as limited supply, has meant that this segment of the market
remains largely immune to the headwinds facing the vast majority of homebuyers.

However, the total number of sales of properties that cost at least 1 million
in Britain was 5 per cent lower last year than in 2010. This compares with a 55
per cent increase in 2010.",5.749411944,0,0,0

She talked about the proposal that would require a woman who had a third child
as the result of rape to justify her position in order to avoid losing tax
credits.

Is that really where we are now setting the bar for providing decent
opportunities for our children - if they are the product of rape? Forgetting the
fact that this is a moral outrage from the get-go, it is completely
unsustainable. How do you qualify for that? Do you have to have a conviction for
rape? Is it just that there's a claim for rape? It is completely unrealistic.

Right-wing think tanks criticise tax credits policy

And Heidi Allen isn't the only right-winger to come out against the tax credits
proposals today.

The Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs - both
Thatcherite think tanks - have criticised the government's proposals.

Sam Bowman, deputy director of the Adam Smith Institute, said  ""working tax
credits are the best form of welfare we have, and cutting them would be a huge
mistake"".

The government has long claimed to want to make work pay for everyone, but
cutting tax credits would disincentivise work and hurt those at the bottom of
society.

Contrary to the government's claims, the National Living Wage will do little to
help those affected by these cuts and, according to the Office for Budget
Responsibility, it risks adding insult to injury by pricing tens of thousands of
workers out of the labour market altogether.

There is little evidence that tax credits 'subsidise' employers, except to the
extent that they make more people willing to work in the first place, creating a
larger pool of workers. The politics of this looks dangerous, too: when it's
working families at the bottom of the income distribution that are being hit
hardest, it's hard to say that we are 'all in this together'. We urge the
Chancellor to rethink these cuts and find savings elsewhere instead.

Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said
the Conservative Party was right to highlight the broad need for reform of tax
credits, which he argued ""ensnares 4.6 million households, at a colossal cost of
30 billion"".

The system is complex, having evolved with the competing aims of encouraging
work and directly alleviating poverty. But rather than completely re-thinking
the point of credits, the particular reforms proposed by the government would
merely slash the threshold above which tax credits are withdrawn and increase
their withdrawal rate. Not only will this make many families worse off, it would
reduce the incentive for many to move into work or earn more, as marginal tax
rates will be as high as 80 per cent.

It's true that it's impossible to save money without taking from some, but
broader reform could have avoided damaging incentives in this way. Instead, the
government used populist rhetoric about 'taxpayers subsidising employers' and
introduced a misguided National Living Wage to mask changes which will
discourage work and harm many low paid workers.

Summary of Heidi Allen's maiden speech

It must have been one of the latest maiden speeches given to parliament since
May, but Heidi Allen's was worth the wait.

Allen said she had her political awakening during the Tottenham riots, which she
said ""shook her from her comfort zone"". She said the spectacle made her feel
that she had to do something and she ""picked the blue team"".

""Believe me when I say that I do entirely agree with the principle that tax
credits shouldn't be used to subsidise wages,"" said Allen. ""It isn't sustainable
and sends the wrong message about the kind of country and people we want to be.""

Heidi Allen giving her maiden speech to parliament. Photograph: Parliament TV

Despite speaking out against the proposed tax credits cuts, Allen said she
wouldn't be voting with the opposition because she still thought the system
needed reform.

""I worry that our single-minded determination to pursue a budget surplus is
betraying who we are,"" she said, adding: ""I know true Conservatives have
compassion running though their veins.""

""I am not interested in the colour of the government who created a bloated
welfare state. That is in the past. I don't care whose fault it is, but I do
know one thing - it is not the fault of the recipients of tax credits,"" said
Allen.

""This is not a spreadsheet exercise... we are talking about real people, working
people.""

Allen criticised the government for talking about the effect its tax credits
changes would have over the course of a parliament. She said many people living
on the breadline couldn't afford to wait that long. ""For many everyday living is
hand-to-mouth living,"" she said.

""Conservatives pride ourselves for living within our means, for cutting our
cloth, but what if there is no more cloth to cut?"" she said.

""I became an MP to stand up for the vulnerable to lead the way for those too
tired to find it for themselves,"" said Allen. ""That is the role of government
too.""

Allen said it was offensive to suggest that Conservative MPs who had criticised
the government's plans were only doing it because they were nervous about losing
their seats.

Cutting tax credits before wages rise does not pass ""the family test"" set by
David Cameron, she said.

""I believe the pace of these reforms is too hard and too fast... Something must
give. For those of us proud enough to call ourselves compassionate
Conservatives, it must not go onto the backs of the working families we purport
to serve.""

Government faces tax credits battle in the Lords - summary

         The Liberal Democrats have announced that they will be voting against
          the government's tax credits proposals in the Lords next week.


Despite only having eight MPs in the Commons, the Lib Dems have 108 peers in the
House of Lords. It is the first time in modern political history that a
Conservative majority government has not also had a majority in the Lords. If
the Labour party and Liberal Democrats vote together in the Lords, they only
need a handful of cross-benchers to vote with them to defeat the government.

By custom and practice, peers do not challenge financial measures and policies
that were in a governing party's manifesto, but Farron has been arguing that the
specific tax credits measure was not in the Conservative party manifesto and was
even specifically denied by David Cameron in a leaders' TV election debate,
after the Guardian revealed a document leaked by the Lib Dems showing that the
government had been considering cuts to tax credits.


         Baroness Meacher has confirmed that she will table a 'fatal motion' to
          kill off the government's tax credits plans in the Lords. Only a
          handful of 'fatal motions' have been successfully passed since the
          1960s, as peers are nervous of being accused of abusing their powers.
          It will be interesting to see how Lords decide to vote on this.


         MPs are debating the tax credits cuts in the Commons. Shadow chief
          secretary to the treasury, Seema Malhotra, said: ""It is clear the
          Government's own side is now in disarray. Lord Tebbit, Boris Johnson,
          Lucy Allan, others now calling for reforms or for the Chancellor to
          think again."" Damian Hinds, exchequer secretary to the treasury, said:
          ""Protecting working people's economic security is and always has been
          a priority for this Government. We are passionate about it because we
          believe in people being allowed to meet their potential, fulfil their
          aspirations wherever they come from in life.""


The debate has seen some dissenting voices on the government benches, including
Edward Leigh and Heidi Allen, who is currently using her maiden speech to
criticise the government's proposals (though she will vote for the motion).

The Huffington Post reported yesterday that a cross-bench peer was being lined
up to table a rarely-used 'fatal motion' and the Financial Times reported that
Baroness Meacher was considering putting it forward.

Only a handful of 'fatal motions' have been successfully passed since the 1960s,
as peers are nervous of abusing their powers.

If the motion was passed it would kill off the government's plans.

The Liberal Democrats - with their disproportionate number of peers (108) - have
been arguing that the Salisbury convention is outdated for months. (The
Salisbury convention dictates that peers shouldn't vote down legislation that
was in a governing party's manifesto.)

My colleague Patrick Wintour has written about the Liberal Democrat plans to
vote against the tax credits cuts in the Lords on Thursday.

The chances of the government being defeated on plans to cut tax credits in the
Lords next week have risen markedly after the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim
Farron, instructed his peers to vote for the fatal motion to block them.

The Lib Dem peer Lord Kirkwood had been planning to move a motion of regret,
which would have amounted to a request for the government to reconsider its
plans.

But Farron's intervention on Tuesday means the government is now likely to be
defeated, requiring ministers to restart the process in the Commons via a new
statutory instrument.

It is important to consider the wider effect of the National Living Wage, says
Hinds. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said that 6m people will
get a pay rise as a result of the measure, a pay rise that will start to take
effect now but will continue until the end of the decade. ""Madame deputy
speaker, we are not just talking about moving to a high wage, low tax, low
welfare economy. We are doing it.""

Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna says that while state subsidy
going to employers to top-up low wages is not desirable, it is the order of the
government's policy that is the problem, ie. cutting tax credits before the
wages go up enough.

noble"", but their cost quickly soared out of control.

""We can kick a problem down the road or we can do something about it...our
reforms don't abolish tax credits or anything close,"" he says.

Owen Smith, shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, says that tax
credits cost 22bn in the last parliament and have gone up to 30bn, so they
have increased on the Tories' watch.

Malhotra. Tackling in-work poverty is crucial, but not in this way.

Work and pensions committee to hold urgent session on tax credits

The commons work and pensions select committee has announced that it will hold
an urgent session on the proposed reforms to the tax credit system on Monday 26
thOctober at 3.30pm.

The committee will look at:


         The impact of the April 2016 tax credit cuts (in isolation and in the
          context of other welfare measures in the Summer Budget), and the
          National Living Wage.
         The winners and losers and their characteristics.
         The extent to which the National Living Wage will compensate
          individuals receiving lower tax credit payments.
         The distributional impact of these measures, individually and
          combined.
         The scale of the financial gains/losses to households and what
          influences this.
         The quality of the analysis produced by the Government to support
          their proposals.
         Other options for achieving savings from the tax credit system that
          will mitigate the impact on the least well off.
         The implications for work incentives and the Government's wider
          objectives in welfare reform.


The session will hear evidence from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, William Elming, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, and Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation.

Frank Field MP, chair of the committee, said:

We hope to be in a position to help the Government reform the tax credit system
on three fronts - to make it fairer, simpler and more affordable. Our reform
blueprint will be built on suggestions that make tax credits a more effective
anti-poverty benefit, so that work always pays a decent income, at no extra cost
to the taxpayer.

A crucial element of this blueprint will be to make it easier for future
governments to make changes at the top end of the income spectrum that do not
necessarily affect claimants at the very bottom of the pile. One of the flaws
exposed by the current political debate on tax credits is the inability to
remove relatively high earners from the welfare system without also clobbering
the poorest workers and their families. We will aim to address such shortcomings
and hope an announcement of mitigating measures will be forthcoming.

Here's a quick lunchtime summary before the tax credits debate in parliament in
about an hour.


         MPs are due to debate tax credits in an opposition day debate on the
          government's tax credits plans. George Osborne has claimed that if he
          had not acted to slash the tax credits bill then 15bn worth of
          spending cuts would have had to be found elsewhere. Stephen
          McPartland, Conservative MP for Stevenage, who has been a vocal
          opponent of the tax credits cuts, told the Daily Politics that he
          still hoped that Osborne would announce measures to mitigate the
          effect of the cuts.


         Tata steel has officially announced that it will cut 1,170 jobs. It is

          the party.


I think its very disappointing that Lord Warner has decided to leave the party
at this time when we do have a new leadership that is now still bedding in. It's
only been a month since the leadership election and I think what we can say

John McDonnell: Tories ""face being the new Lib Dems"" because of tax credits

Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned the Conservatives that they
risk suffering the fate of the Liberal Democrats if they go ahead with their
plans to cut tax credits.

Writing in the Huffington Post, McDonnell said:

In May, the Lib Dems were not forgiven by voters for the false promises that
they gave before the 2010 election on tuition fees. And rightly so, the public
want politicians who will be honest with them. The Tories need to keep their
promises on tax credits or face being the new Lib Dems.

The Tories might arrogantly hope that voters will forget, but decisions like
this define governments. And the three million people who have been lied to
certainly won't forgive the Tories for the false promises they made on tax
credits in May at the next election.

that's going to be a 1,200 cut to a range of families, so if you're a teaching

that's punishing people who get up and go out to work, trying to work their way
out of poverty that we should be rewarding.

Linking to my last post, the Lords will be voting on the government's tax
credits proposals next week. John Pienaar, BBC Radio 5 live's chief political
correspondent, reports that the Liberal Democrats have instructed their peers to
vote against the tax credits cuts.

Unlike their team of eight MPs in the commons, the Liberal Democrats are a
powerful force in the Lords, where they have 108 peers. The Conservative party
does not have a majority in the Lords, but the Salisbury convention dictates
that peers shouldn't vote down legislation that was in a governing party's
manifesto. But Labour and the Lib Dems argue that the Conservative tax credit
plans were not in their manifesto - in fact, David Cameron said he wouldn't cut
tax credits in the run-up to May's general election.

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has released a statement on this afternoon's
opposition day debate on tax credits:

This is George's Poll Tax. George Osborne's attack on working families is an
aggressive assault on millions of people in Britain.

Saying you are listening is cold comfort to hard working people who face losing
a large part of their pay packet.

The Tories promised tax credits were safe during the election but this was
completely untrue. It is time for the Chancellor to show the leadership he so
badly craves and scrap this disastrous policy.

George Osborne should learn from his own party's history, and change his mind on
tax credits, or give up on any desire he has to be Prime Minister.

Labour's Frank Field - who chairs the work and pensions select committee - is
tabling a cross-party motion this afternoon to try and secure a backbench debate
on the tax credit cuts.

The Sun's Steve Hawkes reports that Zac Goldsmith will be among the three Tories
signing it.

enltrConfirmed: Zac Goldsmith, David Davis and Stephen McPartland signing Frank
Field's call for a Commons motion forcing rethink on tax credits

- steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) October 20, 2015

This is the wording of Field's motion -

That this House calls on the Government to bring forward proposals that protect
at nil cost the lowest paid workers from the proposed lowering of the earnings
threshold and increasing of the taper rate for tax credits.

Field writes about his proposal at LabourList. ""George Osborne may unwittingly
have gifted Labour a detonator with which it can blow up the Tories' 2020
election strategy,"" he writes, adding that his motion has received backing from
backbenchers from the Tory party, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, DUP and Plaid
Cymru. Here's a key extract:

This crucial cross-party backing will give us a better chance of winning
concessions from Osborne that could protect the poorest workers and their
families. Remember, we've been here before.

When I helped organise a backbench revolt in 2008 against Gordon Brown's daft
decision to scrap the 10p rate of tax - another all-out assault on low paid
workers - Gordon bizarrely decided the best way to compensate the poor was to
give tax cuts to the whole population.

Some MPs are suggesting that Osborne might follow a similar tax-cutting
strategy. But he mustn't. Such a strategy again would compensate everybody -
including the whole Cabinet - for a cut being made to the poorest workers'
incomes.

Night time politics summary

And so we come to the end of a supremely scrappy sitting fortnight for the
Abbott government. The government has tried to maintain messages around the
economy and national security but has been thrown off balance by a series of
leaks, including of the PMO's talking points.


         Indigenous-only meetings on the constitutional recognition of
          Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander peoples will go ahead after the
          prime minister, Tony Abbott, backed down on his earlier opposition to
          the idea.
         Environment minister Greg Hunt introduced changes to the Environment
          Protection and Biodiversity Act to the lower house, designed to
          severely restrict those who can challenge resource developments on
          environmental grounds.
         Dyson Heydon received three submissions from different unions urging
          him to stand aside as commissioner of Turc on the grounds of bias
          because he accepted (and later declined) and invitation to a Liberal
          party fundraiser. He will hear their claims in Sydney tomorrow but
          government ministers said he was not likely to step down.
         The government declared a campaign by the unions against the China FTA
          as ""vile"" and ""racist"", rejecting claims that the labour provisions
          allow Chinese workers to come into the country without mandatory
          labour market testing.
         In the same breath, three senior Liberals came out to talk about the
          government's planned citizenship changes, which strip citizenship from
          dual nationals for ""jeopardising"" other Australians. Philip Ruddock
          and Connie Fierravanti-Wells will be criss-crossing the country over
          the next two weeks to talk to communities which have a mix of old and
          new Australians, to paraphrase Ruddock.
         Cabinet talking points leaked for the second time in as many days.
          According to the list, the cabinet is still working exceptionally
          well.
         Following an intelligence leak to the Daily Telegraph, immigration
          minister Peter Dutton finally confirmed that seven young Australians
          had been stopped from travelling overseas. He rejected any suggestion
          that the announcement had anything to do with a reported strategy of
          weekly national security announcements until the next election. He
          called it ""nonsense gossip"".


While everyone is starting to scatter back to their electorates, obviously
tomorrow will be an equally large news day, given the Heydon hearing at the
Turc. Daniel Hurst will be live blogging the hearing - so watch out for that.

The other part you need to know is that the promised week in indigenous
communities promised by Tony Abbott is happening from Sunday. Alas I will not be
attending but we will endeavour to cover it.

Thanks to the brains trust, Lenore Taylor, Shalailah Medhora and Daniel Hurst.
Mike Bowers ' pictures painted well over a thousand words.

Thanks for your company and see you in this space after the break.

Good night.

I'm tidying up now. The other thing I missed was the actual address on the prime

career. It would appear he does not have the passion of John Howard about the
game.

Unlike some prime ministers, I haven't been a cricket tragic. I wasn't much of a
cricketer. In fact, as I think I've said previously on this occasion, I was
taken down to the nets in year seven at St Ignatius College and after they
watched me bowl a wide and you know, a swipe outside off stump they said, 'off
you go to the rowing sheds, that's where you're going! But then, of course,
years later I found myself in the United Kingdom as a student at Oxford and I
discovered the only way to get a drink in the afternoon was to play cricket
because the bar at the cricket ground was open all afternoon and didn't close
between 2.00 and 5.00 as the pubs did in those days in the United Kingdom. So, I
became a very enthusiastic cricketer!

Bishop supports marriage equality kinda sorta

Just before question time, the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, ever so
cautiously signalled her potential support for same-sex marriage. It was a less
than emphatic declaration.

Bishop, who spoke up in support of a population-wide vote known as a plebiscite
during the Coalition party room meeting last week, has previously refused to say
one way or another whether she personally was in favour of same-sex marriage.

In an interview with Peter van Onselen on Sky News, Bishop said she was a former
lawyer and current legislator and had always wanted to look at the detail of
legislation before expressing her view.

Bishop:

I don't have any answers yet from those who are promoting same-sex marriage for
some of the concerns that I have as to how this will impact on religious
institutions or those who refuse to conduct same-sex marriage, what sort of
sanctions would be in place, what sort of exemptions there would be.""

Van Onselen:

Is it a fair characterisation of what you just said that you are philosophically
not opposed to same-sex marriage but the logistics and the legalities of how it
is framed may make you support or not support such legislative change, would
that be a fair characterisation?""

Bishop:

Go back one step first. I'm the deputy leader of the party and a member of
cabinet so of course I support the government's position as articulated by the
prime minister on behalf of the cabinet and the party and that is there be no
change to the Marriage Act in this term of parliament. I support that policy,
but the prime minister said that after the election then it's time for the
people to have their say, so I think you have articulated my position rather
well - while maintaining cabinet and party solidarity on our current position.
That's why I think that there were many people in a position such as I am
philosophically who want to have their say in the sanctity of the ballot box and
I think this is precisely the kind of issue where a plebiscite is called for,
otherwise I think representative govt works exceedingly well.

I think that it's very important that we clearly understand that local
agricultural producers and others with legitimate proprietary economic and

that their voices will be heard and there will be protection of their rights.
Farming groups can still use their organisation and resources to support

          raise jobs, growth and community safety. He also met with the world
          champion Australian netball team, the Diamonds. Having held aloft the
          AFL cup with Bill Shorten last night.
         A story in the Daily Telegraph provided by a ""senior intelligence
          source"" revealed seven young Australians were stopped at Sydney
          airport, allegedly planning to fight with terrorist organisations.
         The PM picked up this news and ran with it but did not provide any
          further details.
         Sometime later, Peter Dutton, Connie Fierravanti-Wells and Philip
          Ruddock announced there would be community forums in ""in areas where
          there is the interface between Australians of long standing if I can
          put it that way as well as our newer Australians"". They said in their
          discussions so far, people want some sort of sanction for fellow
          citizens who jeopardise other Australians.

You Diamonds dreamed. What about my dreams?

Tony Abbott to the Diamonds:

We absolutely admire you and we have even, in our own way, tried to emulate you
with a team called the Owls, the parliamentary netball team. You may not have
heard but they did take on New Zealand. What turned out to be a stacked New
Zealand team. You can't trust those Kiwis. It was a New Zealand parliamentary
team stacked with Silver Ferns, so if any of you are invited to apply for
pre-selection, it is to improve the quality of the Owls around this place. In
the Abbott household, netball is a family passion. My girls played, my wife
coached and I cheered, yes, Susan, I have long been a netball dad but today, I
am very proud to be a netball prime minister. Well done Diamonds.

Bill Shorten to the Diamonds:

Every Diamond here represents a pyramid of people, probably two or more. Last
weekend you brought pride and pleasure to all Australians but in particular, it
was that pyramid of people who have helped you become diamonds whowere so
excited for you. People at the local club and state levels, your families. I can
assure these marvellous Diamonds that on their journey, from your first game of
juniors, to the fund raising, to the coaching, your friends, anyone who has ever
come into contact with you, is so excited for you and for your marvellous
journey. It is great there is so many young girls here today, because as little
girls, you Diamonds dreamed.

I dreamed a dream. Of grand orators. Then I woke up.

People always underestimate Tony Abbott, says Morrison, who rules out leadership

Q: Josh Frydenberg this morning has described Tony Abbott as the next John
Howard in terms from coming from behind in the polls and making it. What do you
think of that description?

People always underestimate Tony Abbott, the Labor party always have and Tony
Abbott is someone who sticks and he is someone who is determined to bring about
the sort of Australia that I think all Australians can realise their aspirations
and expectations. That is why he has such strong support in the Liberal party
and National party as well within the Coalition. My message to Bill Shorten is
never underestimate Tony Abbott, mate.

Is Tony Abbott underestimating you? We have heard you might be a future
contender for leader and we haven't seen you rule that out?

I did actually.

I heart negative gearing: Scott Morrison

Scott Morrison does not buy the rhetoric on negative gearing pushing up housing
prices.

What negative gearing has done for many years is ensure that there is a supply
of rental accommodation, not just new but old and there is houses out there that
people can actually rent. The average person who was engaged in investing in
residential real estate using those arrangements has a taxable income of around
about $80,000 a year and they own one property. The other thing those families
are doing is they are providing for their own retirement and many of them are
engaging in negative gearing so they can get a foot hold into the housing market
to buy their own home. I don't buy the rhetoric which is run by many
commentators when it comes to negative gearing.

Young Australians are better educated than in the past but more likely to be
unemployed, unmarried and living at home with their parents, a snapshot of
demographic trends has found.

More young people are joining the dole queue, with the youth unemployment rate
increasing from 8.8% in 2008 to 13.3% in 2014, according to the biennial welfare
report card from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).

Follow live updates as Syrian government troops continue the bombardment of
Homs, inflicting scores more casualities, according to activists

FULL TEXT

3.42pm: Hague: Britain has recalled its ambassador from Syria.

3.42pm: Hague: This is a doomed regime as well as a murdering regime.

We will continue our strong support for Arab League. We will seek to widen the
international coalition seeking peace in Syria. Intensify diplomatic and
economic pressure on the regime. UK will also intensify contact with Syrian
opposition. Maintain strong focus at UN, continue to look for meaningful way
forward. We will work through UN human rights council.

3.39pm: Hague: Extensive efforts were made to address Russia's concerns. We
regard this veto as a grave error of judgement by the governments of Russia and
China -- a betrayal of the Syrian people. They have increased risk of civil war
and placed themselves on the wrong side of Arab and international opinion.

3.37pm: Hague continues: There was nothing objectionable in the UN resolution
that was proposed by Morocco - did not impose sanctions or authorise military
action.

3.36pm: William Hague is now speaking about Syria. Appalled by bloodshed and
repression. Utterly unacceptable situation demanding united international
response.

3.30pm: British foreign secretary William Hague has now arrived in the House of
Commons chamber to make his statement about Syria.

3.25pm: We shall be liveblogging the British foreign secretary's statement on
Syria which is expected in a few minutes. You can also watch it live here.

2.46pm: The Local Co-ordination Committees group in Syria has posted a statement
it says is from members of the minority Alawite sect (a branch of Shia Islam,
which Bashar al-Assad belongs to) in Homs and coastal cities, condemning the
assault by government forces.

The upper echelons of Assad's regime are largely populated by Alawites and the
president has portrayed the uprising as sectarian in nature, with most of the
protesters Sunni. Even some opposition activists have admitted sectarian
tensions have been to the fore in Homs, although they have blamed the government
for stoking them.

The statement on the LCC website says:

We call upon all sects and ethnic minority groups to unite as one and to halt
all efforts put forth by the Assad regime to drag the country into a
never-ending civil war. We, the Syrian Alawites, warn all of our brothers and
sisters in Syria that Assad's army has been using Alawite dominated
neighborhoods in Homs, to launch its assaults on the remaining neighborhoods and
surrounding areas. It has been doing so to spark a sectarian revenge among the
people of Homs. We hold Assad's regime and forces along with Ba'ath Party
members at home and abroad, completely responsible for the massacres in the
country. In particular, we hold them responsible for igniting sectarian strife
to divide Syria.

Meanwhile, the LCC says Monday's death toll in Homs has risen to 36 (the Syrian
National Council said very early on that 50 people had been killed). The LCC
says another 10 people have been killed in the rest of the country.

2.33pm: In a comment article for the Guardian, Wadah Khanfar, former
director-general of al-Jazeera, draws some parallels between the 1982 massacre
in Hama and what is happening in Homs now. He writes:

Hafiz al-Assad's regime managed to get away with the massacre of Hama in 1982
because of the international silence dictated by the balance of forces during
the cold war and a media blackout, which denied the victims a voice and
prevented them from presenting the images of their calamity.

It is true that the regional and international balance of power continues to
play a negative role in ending the suffering of the Syrian people. But the
Syrians - as other Arab people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen - have now
become the most important actors in the flow of events. This would enable them
to overcome all external factors in their quest for freedom from tyranny and
repression.

2.13pm: The United States has closed its embassy in Syria, CNN is reporting. The
last of its 17 employees, including Ambassador Robert Ford, left Syria on Monday
morning, travelling by road in a convoy to neighbouring Jordan, according to
State Department officials cited by the TV channel.

The US appears to be blaming the embassy's closure on Syrian authorities'
failure to address its security concerns.

Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, is due to address parliament in just
over an hour and the US decision raises the possibility that the UK is about to
do the same.

1.50pm: President Obama says it is important to resolve the conflict in Syria
without outside military intervention.

In an interview on NBC's Today programme, he said that not every situation
allows for the type of military action the US and allies took in Libya against
Colonel Gaddafi. He added that he believes a negotiated solution in Syria is
possible.

1.19pm: Iran, rather predictably, has welcomed the Russian and Chinese vetoes
over Syria. In remarks quoted by the official news agency, IRNA, foreign
minister Ali Akbar Salehi said:

The security council has become a tool for the west's bullying of other nations,
and this time Russia and China stood up against it.

The security council ... wanted to take a path in deciding a head of state,
while it is not within the functions of this council to interfere in other
nations' internal affairs.

12.53pm: Here's a summary of the main developments so far today:

Syria

[#xfffd] Activists says a number of people have been killed in Homs after
government troops renewed shelling of the restive city. The Syrian National
Council put the death toll at 50 while the Local Co-ordination Committees, which
said a field hospital was hit during the bombardment, said 19 people had been
killed. Their figures cannot be independently verified. The BBC's Paul Wood said
mortars were landing every 30 seconds from 6am and troops were reportedly
massing on the outskirts of the city. Syrian state media accused ""armed
terrorist groups"" of firing mortars in the city, setting fire to tyres and
blowing up empty buildings to give the impression that Homs was under fire from
Assad's forces.

[#xfffd] The head of the Arab League, Nabil Elaraby, expressed his anxiety about
the ""escalation of military operations in the city of Homs ....and the Syrian
armed forces' use of heavy weapons against civilians"". He warned that conditions
were sliding ""towards civil war"".

[#xfffd] The Syrian government and opposition activists blamed each other for
the explosion of a pipeline in Babr Amr, a hotbed of resistance. The two sides
have repeatedly traded accusations over the past few days in relation to
explosions at a series of gas and oil pipelines.

[#xfffd] The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, will make a statement to
parliament this afternoon, amid pressure for Britain to withdraw diplomatic
recognition of Syria, after Tunisia issued a call for Syria's isolation and
protesters clashed with police outside the mission in London.Britain said on
Monday it is looking at possible further European Union sanctions on Syria

[#xfffd][#xfffd]Shelling by government forces has also been reported in
Zabadani, near the border with Lebanon. Zabadani is said to be under the control
of the Free Syrian Army. The Syrian government claimed an ""armed terrorist""
group was attacking buildings in the area.

[#xfffd] The last remaining member of Hamas's Damascus-based politburo has now
left Syria, according to a German news agency report carried by Haaretz. Imad
el-Alami, a senior Hamas figure who was deported by Israel in 1991, arrived in
Gaza on Sunday, via Egypt. The report said: ""Hamas decided to leave Syria in
order not to be seen as endorsing the regime of President Bashar Assad in his
bloody crackdown against his own people.""

Egypt

[#xfffd] Ignoring a US threat to cut off aid, Egypt has referred 19 Americans
and 24 other employees of non-profit groups to trial before a criminal court on
accusations they illegally used foreign funds to foment unrest in the country.
Egypt's military rulers had already deeply strained ties with Washington with
their crackdown on US-funded groups promoting democracy and human rights and
accused of stirring up violence in the aftermath of the uprising a year ago that
ousted President Hosni Mubarak.

[#xfffd] Egypt will prepare Cairo's Torah prison hospital so it can receive
ousted President Hosni Mubarak from the military hospital where he is now
detained, an interior ministry official said on Sunday. Protesters, who have
clashed with police for four days demanding an end to military rule, have long
complained that the ruling generals have been sparing their former commander the
humiliation of prison by keeping him in a military hospital. Members of
Mubarak's old regime already in the prison have been split up after they were
blamed by some for the violence at a football match last week that left scores
dead.

12.43pm: The head of the Arab League has said the Syrian army's use of heavy
weapons against civilians is an escalation that edges the country towards civil
war, Reuters reports.

Nabil Elaraby said in a statement:

We follow with great anxiety and irritation developments in the field situation
in Syria, and the escalation of military operations in the city of Homs and
rural areas of Damascus, and the Syrian armed forces' use of heavy weapons
against civilians.

In the statement published by the Egyptian state news agency, Elaraby said the
escalation took the crisis in Syria in ""a serious direction"", adding that it
pushed conditions ""towards civil war"".

12.18pm: Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague (left), is expected to
address the Commons on the situation in Syria at 3.30pm GMT today.

Following the UN security council vote on Saturday, Hague issued a statement
commenting on the Russian and Chinese vetoes. He said:

The draft resolution, tabled by Morocco, supported Arab League efforts to
resolve the crisis in Syria and called for an immediate end to all violence. It
did not impose any sanctions, nor did it authorise military action. At every
stage we worked to accommodate the concerns of some Council members and tabled a
text which did just that. There was nothing in the draft to warrant opposition.

12.01pm:The Local Co-ordination Committees group (LCC) says 19 people have been
killed in Homs so far today. The Syrian National Council told Reuters 50 have
been killed in Homs.

The LCC says 26 people have been killed across Syria today so far, with four
killed in Madaya, in Damascus suburbs, two in Aleppo and one in Idlib.

Due to restricted access for foreign journalists, the reported death tolls
cannot be independently verified.

11.53am: Syrian army defectors have announced the formation of a higher military
council to ""liberate"" the country from President Bashar al-Assad's rule, Reuters
reports.

The council, named ""The Higher Revolutionary Council"" and designed to supersede
the Free Syrian Army (FSA), said its head was General Mustafa Ahmed al-Sheikh,
the highest ranking deserter who had fled to Turkey. The council's spokesman is
Major Maher al-Naimi, previously the FSA spokesman, according to a statement
sent to Reuters. It said:

After consultations with defectors across the homeland and after careful
organisation of their ranks the formation of a Higher Revolutionary Council to
Liberate Syria has been agreed in response to the call of freedom and ahead of
freeing Syria from this gang.

The US-based Syrian dissident, Ammar Abdulhamid, was scathing about the
announcement, coming against a backdrop of increasing bloodshed. He wrote:

In a typical fashion Syrian opposition groups responded to the massacres by
issuing more statements and forming new groups and councils that decried
divisiveness. Today, the highest ranking officer to defect to Turkey, Major
General Mustafa Ahmad Al-Sheikh, announced the formation of the High Syrian
Council for the Liberation of Syria. Two days ago, a group of 70 Syrians
announced the formation of the National Current for Change.

11.29am: The Syrian government has denied its forces are shelling Homs. Instead,
the state news agency, Sana, reports (Arabic) that ""armed terrorist groups"" have
stormed homes, attacking the occupants.

Additionally, it reports ""armed terrorist groups"" attacking civilians in
Zabadani, near the border with Lebanon, which has also been shelled today,
according to activists.

11.19am: The Guardian's Abdel-Rahman Hussein has an update of developments from
Egypt, including the continued fallout from the deaths at a football match last
week:

Parliament has convened again to discuss the latest developments and what can be
done to handle the fallout of events since Wednesday. The death toll since the
tragic events at the football match has now reached 13.

More walls have gone up in downtown Cairo and numerous attempts at brokering
truces have been wrecked by the liberal use of teargas by security forces.
Sunday night saw some of the worst clashes as police armored vehicles drove up
to the field hospital and started firing buckshot under cover of teargas,
forcing the field hospital to move.

More walls have been built in the area around the Interior Ministry. Streets
which saw the majority of fighting such as Nubar and Mansour now have
three-tiered block walls on them. This ability to keep protesters far from the
ministry didn't stop security forces from continuing to fire teargas at them.
And it was from behind those walls that the assault on the field hospital took
place.

Meanwhile, recommendations of the national security committee in parliament
seemed to place culpability of the entire affair squarely on the old regime, and
thus their advice that the cabal in Torah prison be split up has been heeded.

Additionally, it is expected that ousted president Hosni Mubarak will be moved
from the International Medical Centre to the hospital of Torah prison today.

10.59am: In a blogpost, entitled ""Why won't you help us?"" the US-based Syrian
dissident Ammar Abdulhamid argues that if the rebels were properly armed, Homs
would be ""liberated"".

The story on the ground in Homs in particular is this: loyalists cannot stand up
to local rebels in direct combat, they are always pushed out to the outskirts of
rebellious communities after each assault, and they are in fact losing ground.
But from their position on the outskirts they can continue to inflict damage on
rebels by indiscriminately pounding their strongholds with artillery and mortar
fire. That's what's happening in Old Homs, and that's what's happening in the
town of Rastan, among other restive communities.

Should rebels lay their hands on more sophisticated weaponry, the entire
momentum of the current conflict will shift to their side. Liberated town will
become truly liberated and protected, and the Assad and their loyalists will be
forced to be truly on the defensive for once. It's only when this situation is
created on the ground that the world can push for a negotiated settlement. By
that time, the Assads will have been sufficiently weakened within their own camp
as well for other likely leaders to emerge and influence the decision-making
process.

10.41am:Video has been posted online purporting to be of the pipeline in the
beseiged Homs district of Babr Amr, where an explosion was reported by activists
this morning (see 9.45am).

It is not only Homs that has come under heavy attack today, according to
activists. The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC) report the shelling by heavy
artillery targeting homes in Zabadani, near the border with Lebanon. Zabadani
was described by some last month as Syria's first liberated city. This video
purports to show a house that was shelled in Zabadani.The LCC also reports a
""complete siege"" of Deraa, in the south, with people prevented from entering or
leaving. It also says there has been continuous gunfire.

10.16am: A brief update from Yemen. President Ali Abdullah Saleh looks happy
enough in this picture, taken as he left the Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York on
Sunday, but he was confronted by protesters. One demonstrator reportedly threw a
shoe, narrowly missing him.

Saleh, who is due to be replaced by his deputy in a one-candidate election on 21
February, is on what is officially described as a private medical visit to the
US.

He was badly injured by an explosion in his palace last June but there have been
suggestions to the medical reasons were just an excuse to get him away from
Yemen. Last month, Gerald Feierstein, the US ambassador in Sana'a, was quoted as
saying: ""We think that him not being here [in Yemen] will help the transition,
we think it will improve the atmosphere.""

Saleh has been granted immunity from prosecution by the Yemeni parliament but on
Sunday the New York protesters were calling for him to be referred to the
international criminal court. Some of them chanted: ""ICC not NYC"".

10.06am: As has become customary in recent days, the Syrian government and
opposition are trading accusations over explosions at oil pipelines. No sooner
had activists reported an explosion at a pipeline in Baba Amr (see 9.45am) than
the Syrian state news agency, Sana, has said an ""armed group"" has attacked a
pipeline in Jobar, also in Homs.

9.59am: The last remaining member of Hamas's Damascus-based politburo has now
left Syria, according to a German news agency report carried by Haaretz. Imad
el-Alami, a senior Hamas figure who was deported by Israel in 1991, arrived in
Gaza on Sunday, via Egypt. The report says:

Hamas decided to leave Syria in order not to be seen as endorsing the regime of
President Bashar Assad in his bloody crackdown against his own people.

9.45am: An explosion has ripped through an oil pipeline feeding a main refinery
in Homs, al-Jazeera is reporting, citing residents and activists.

The explosion, the second in a week that hit the pipeline, which carries crude
oil from the eastern Rumailan field, occurred in the district of Bab Amr, an
opposition stronghold under heavy tank and mortar bombardment and rocket fire by
President Bashar al-Assad's forces, they said.

9.40am:The BBC's Paul Wood, in Homs, spoke live to Radio 4's Today programme in
a conversation punctuated by the sound of explosions in the background (thanks
to BrownMoses below the line for the link to the Audioboo). He said people fear
an invasion by government ground troops.

It was a quiet night till just dawn when at 6am we started hearing mortars
falling, I would think about one every 30 seconds. That's been going on,
on-and-off, for the past two hours. And also some heavier artillery has been
used ...

I spoke to the Free Army Commander last night ...and they have been trying to
attack checkpoints on the periphery of this part of Homs but it really is
absolutely futile when the government has tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy
weapons. We are hearing a report this morning, not confirmed but from an
eyewitness saying government troops have been moving up to the outskirts of this
part of Homs, not military vehicles or tanks but ground troops. They haven't yet
gone through the first rebel checkpoint, the Free Army checkpoint, so there's
not yet an invasion but clearly that's what people fear is going to happen over
the next day or so.

9.19am: A number of videos purporting to show the results of today's shelling of
Homs have been posted online. This one shows dense black smoke rising:

Another purportedly shows the field hospital, which the Local Co-ordination
Committees group says was attacked today. (warning: graphic).

The BBC says the Syrian government has denied shelling Homs.

8.58am:China's leading Communist party newspaper has defended Beijing's
rejection of a United Nations resolution calling for Syria's president, Bashar
al-Assad, to resign. The People's Daily said western campaigns in Libya,
Afghanistan and Iraq showed the error of forced regime change. From the
Guardian:

""The situation in Syria continues to deteriorate and numbers of civilian
casualties keep rising. Vetoing the draft security council resolution does not
mean we are giving free rein to letting this heart-rending state of affairs
continue,"" said the paper, which echoes government thinking.

China, unlike its western critics, was acting ""responsibly"" for the sake of the
Syrian people, it said. The author used the pen name Zhong Sheng, which can mean
""voice of China"" and is often used on articles giving Beijing's position on
foreign policy.

""Currently the situation in Syria is extremely complex. Simplistically
supporting one side and suppressing the other might seem a helpful way of
turning things around, but in fact it would be sowing fresh seeds of disaster.""

8.47am:In an article for Slate, international affairs commentator Michael Moran
looks at the UN security council and points out that the debacle over a
resolution on Syria is only the latest of its many failings. It's not only the
Russians and the Chinese who cast ""narrow, paranoid vetoes"", he says - and it's
time to put a stop to it. Moran writes:

The idea that any power should preempt a majority of the planet's most powerful
states simply by issuing a veto is the most egregious of all the anachronisms
that have survived at the UN ... This veto power - far more than the theatre of
the absurd that is the General Assembly - [does] more to undermine the
institution than any other single factor.

Once vetoes are gone, the addition of a set of emerging powers and a
consolidation of the French and British seats into a single EU vote would be
possible. Japan, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt and perhaps South
Africa added as permanent members would force real negotiations on the world's
most important issues, transforming the United Nations from a sideshow to the
main show.

8.44am: Welcome to Middle East Live. The focus is once more on Syria where the
bombardment of Homs is continuing.

Syria

[#xfffd] Syrian troops shelled neighborhoods in the restive city of Homs on
Monday, a day after President Bashar al-Assad's government vowed to continue its
deadly crackdown on the country's uprising, killing 50 people, the Syrian
National Council said.another attack on the central Syrian city that activists
say killed 200 people, the highest death toll reported for a single day in the
11-month uprising. The Local Co-ordination Committees activist group said
Monday's bombardment hit a makeshift hospital in the tense neighborhood of Baba
Amr, causing casualties.

[#xfffd] Russia may be seeking a ""controlled demolition"" of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad's rule to save its sole major foothold in the Arab world against
western rivals when its foreign minister and spy chief hold rare talks in
Damascus this week, Reuters reported, citing an analyst at the British
think-tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Russia's foreign
minister, Sergei Lavrov, said he would travel to Syria on Tuesday along with
foreign intelligence service director Mikhail Fradkov for talks with Assad.
Lavrov revealed nothing about their purpose, but a foreign ministry statement on
Sunday indicated he and Fradkov would at least press Assad, who has ruled out
resigning and rejected his opponents as ""terrorists"", to make compromises.

[#xfffd][#xfffd]. The foreign minister, William Hague, said: ""We constantly
review our diplomatic relations. We haven't taken any decision to sever our
relations.""

[#xfffd] Saboteurs on Sunday blew up a pipeline in Egypt that supplied gas to
Israel, the 12th such attack in a year, security officials said. Masked gunmen
planted explosives under the pipeline near the town of El Arish in the north of
the Sinai peninsula, they said. Witnesses said they heard a loud explosion
before a large fire broke out. Sources said that the attack on the pipeline
occurred the day after an Islamist leader from the area died in his prison cell
in Cairo. Interior ministry officials said he died from natural causes.",13.8059438,1,1,1

Summary - Who won?

Conventional wisdom has it that election debates favour the outsiders, the
insurgent parties.

But this evening that did not happen. It was the mainstream, establishment
parties that emerged with substantial gains. And the two figures who have most
cause to feel disappointed were the challengers.

Whether or not David Cameron gained more than Ed Miliband is not entirely clear.
But they both secured some advantage from the proceedings.

Ed Miliband came away looking plausible and authoritative, and the CCHQ claim
that he is a third-rate liability continues to look ever more shaky. He can
claim to have ""won"" the debate on the polling evidence (even if the methodology
looks a bit odd - see 11.59pm) and he got a platform to taunt Cameron for not
daring to debate him head-to-head on primetime TV. This won't necessarily win
him the election, but he took a risk deciding to take part, and it did not go
wrong.

David Cameron 's refusal to turn up was demeaning, but he is probably right in
thinking that most voters won't bother with such media processology and he has
managed to get the media talking, yet again, about the prospect of Labour
governing with the support of the SNP. Even though Miliband faced Sturgeon down
on this about as robustly as he could, the prospect of Labour governing with SNP
votes does seem to alarm some English voters, which is why the Tories are
campaigning on this so strongly. Tonight's debate will enable Cameron to keep
the scare running.

In Westminster Nicola Sturgeon is perceived as an insurgent, but her party is in
power in Edinburgh and she has been a minister since 2007, making her more
experienced in government than Cameron. She is also a remarkably good debater,
and it showed again tonight. But, having made such a big impression last time,
she made less of an impact tonight, and probably came off worse in her final
showdown with Miliband. (See 9.41pm.)

Natalie Bennett came top on one Twitter sentiment analysis, and performed quite
strongly overall, and yet she failed to make the impact some might have expected
when the Greens were polling at their peak a few months ago. Why? Because there
were three alternative, anti-austerity, anti-nuclear leftish progressive women,
and she was not the most dominant. She was outshone by Sturgeon. Much the same
could be said for Leanne Wood, although she does not need to make a splash
UK-wise, and will probably get a deservedly good write-up in Wales.

And Nigel Farage has had better nights. When he debated Nick Clegg last year, he
was exciting and reasonably plausible. But now his determination to pick fights
seems contrived, he has given up on moderate opinion, and he seems to have
retreated into Ukip core-vote appeasment. Like Bennett, he did not do badly, by
any means. But he may have gone home thinking the debate did not give him quite
the boost he was expecting.

That's all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments.

Earlier I was speculating why the Survation poll found that Ed Miliband won the
debate, even though the respondents said Nicola Sturgeon performed the best.
(See 11.16pm.) But Sam Freedman has explained it.

When respondents were asked about who performed the best, the question started:
""Putting aside your own party preference and basing your answer on what you saw
or heard during the programme...""

But Survation did not use this preamble for the first question, which was
simply: ""Who do you think 'won' the debate""?

Freedman has posted a link to the tables on Twitter.

It is not clear why the questions were not asked in a consistent way, but I have

Rachel Sylvester at the Times (paywall) says the David Cameron may regret not
turning up.

There was one question tonight: would Ed Miliband be the representative of the
Westminster establishment, attacked on all sides by the insurgents, or would he
look like the only statesman on the stage?

On balance, I thought he looked prime ministerial while still having a bit of
Opposition zeal...

The crucial moment came when Ms Sturgeon challenged Mr Miliband to join forces
with her to defeat the Tories. ""I can help Labour be bolder"", she declared, a
dream for Conservative spin-doctors. But the Labour man came back immediately
with a ""no"" telling her: ""I have fundamental disagreements with you, Nicola,""
and insisting: ""I've fought Tories all my life.""

His straight to camera invitation to the prime minister in the closing statement
- ""debate me and let the people decide"" - only reinforced the impression of
confidence.

At one point Mr Miliband slipped into saying ""when I'm Prime Minister I will...""
It was presumably a deliberate attempt to make the voters imagine him in Number
10.

I wonder whether David Cameron now regrets not turning up.

But James Forsyth at Coffee House says the night may have worked out to
Cameron's advantage.

But the last question was about hung parliaments and it is this which caused
Miliband some problems. He stuck to his line about Labour wanting an overall
majority and warned about the risks of voting SNP. But Sturgeon took the
opportunity to set out how she and the other progressive parties would make
Labour 'better'. I suspect that as we speak CCHQ is cutting the footage into a
new attack video. The BBC News at Ten led with this part of the debate and if
the BBC news machine decides this is the main story of the night then it could
become a problem for Labour and would justify Cameron's decision to avoid this
debate.

They are rather confusing. When people were asked who ""won"" the debate, Ed
Miliband came out on top. But, when they were asked who ""performed the best"",
Nicola Sturgeon won. She was on 35%, ahead of Miliband on 29% and Farage on 26%.

How do we make sense of that? Because, when asked who performed best, you may be
making an objective judgment about technical debating skills (see 8.29pm) while,
when asked who ""won"", you may be making a more subjective judgment about the
leader you favoured the most.

This would explain why the Survation panel also thought Miliband would make the
best prime minister (43%, ahead of Farage on 26% and Sturgeon on 25%) and why
they also thought he had the most convincing arguments (31%, joint equal with
Farage, ahead of Sturgeon on 24%).

But the Survation findings will reinforce Lewis Baston's belief that post-debate
polling is a waste of time.

And this is Deborah Mattinson's report of the event:

Fewer of our panellists tuned in tonight, and several of those who did confessed
that they would not have done so had we not asked them to - and that it was,
well, a little dull. One said he'd rather be watching Double Decker Driving
School on ITV. Quite a few did not stay the distance...

Those who did persist concluded that Nicola Sturgeon was the 'winner': with Ed
Miliband the closest runner-up. Sturgeon continued to impress with her passion
and verve: her attacks on Farage drew particular praise, and prompting one
panelist from Taunton Deane to complain that 'voting Nicola' was not possible.
Miliband walked a fine line between seeming the establishment figure drawing
fire that might have belonged more naturally to Cameron, and talking what one
panelist described as 'real politics'. For the first time in the campaign
several voters described his as 'Prime Ministerial'.

Farage found less support than in the previous debate, although a minority
praised his determination to 'speak the truth'. Few commented on Wood and
Bennett who seemed more out shadowed than they had when there were seven players
on the stage.

Although our panelists often enjoyed the spats, some likened it to PMQs with
poor behaviour from politicians and audience alike.

Here is more analysis from the Twitter sentiment analysis carried out by Demos
and others. (See 9.59pm.) This is from their post-debate summary.

In terms of ratio, the biggest winner was Nicola Sturgeon (80% cheers), followed
by Ed Miliband (74% cheers). The biggest loser was Cameron's empty chair (69%
boos). Farage was the only leader to have more boos than cheers, but still had
more cheers than any other leader (7,359).

The biggest Tweet (by far) was for ""David Cameron has decided not to attend
tonight's debate. If you're applying for the job of PM, you should turn up to
the job interview"" [3245 retweets: tweeted by Ed Miliband]

Farage is receiving a huge amount of the Twitter traffic. As of writing, he's
received more traffic than all of the other contestants combined, peaking when
he was booed by the audience when he said he was talking to the 'real audience'
at home. The audience on Twitter didn't like that all.

In contrast, the biggest moments for both Sturgeon and Miliband were when
challenging Farage on immigration, the clapping from the studio echoed across
the Twittersphere. Miliband's only time with more boos than cheers was also
under challenge from Sturgeon not to miss the opportunity to keep the Tories out
of government.

Cameron couldn't escape the debate, his biggest moment coming as both Sturgeon
and Miliband criticized his no show early on.

On Nicola Sturgeon...

Nicola Sturgeon certainly played a blinder. Her game is a tricky one - to make
Labour look like the only alternative to the Conservatives in England, while
reminding Scotland that it, of course, doesn't have to put up with the brand of
Labour that Westminster serves up to the rest of the country. She'd do anything
to ""kick the Tories out"" - anything except sacrifice her own party in an
election it can never win.

That she manages such a feat is testament to her brilliance as a politician. She
got in big digs against the Tories. She thought it a ""disgrace"" that David
Cameron wasn't taking part in the debate. She thought the Conservative
right-to-buy social housing notion was ""one of the worst ideas I've ever heard.""
But she also made Miliband look like the lucky guy who could bask in her
charisma if only he'd stop being such a boring, ole PM in waiting.

Sturgeon, above all, reminds voters in England that if you're still thinking of
a left-wing protest vote, then you're out of luck. She's got that business all
sewn up. Stray from Labour in England and you really will let the Tories in,
because Scotland isn't going to be there to make up the Labour safe-seat
numbers. For sure.

On Leanne Wood...

An opposition that promises more of the same is no opposition at all,"" said
Leanne Wood, underlining her conviction that she will not prop up a Labour
government ""hell-bent on implementing Tory cuts."" Her final speech ended with
the words ""diolch yn fawr"" (thank you in Welsh), reflecting her insistence on
speaking directly to Wales - a strategy which was apparent from the start
despite having led to criticism after the ITV debates.

""Plaid Cymru will not apologise for speaking up for Wales at every opportunity"",
she said. And rightly so. As a minority party committed to civic nationalism,
Plaid has never claimed to be in a position to pursue the interests of English
voters. To viewers Welsh and English alike, however, Wood attempted to prove
that there exists an alternative to the ""grey, stale politics as usual,"" and I
think she achieved that.

Calm, though occasionally slightly hesitant, Wood spoke with great feeling,
underlining Plaid's commitment to a post-austerity Wales, her passionate belief
in the importance of the welfare state, and her obvious distain for the divisive
anti-immigration politics of Farage, or ""her friend on the far right,"" as she
scathingly put it (I cheered). ""You abuse immigrants & those with HIV and then
complain UKIP is being abused,"" she told him, with fire in her voice. Like
Sturgeon, she did not shake his hand before walking off stage.

Obviously popular, Wood's statements were met with frequent applause, though her
attempts to challenge Miliband fell rather flat, not least because he didn't
care to answer any of her questions.

Reporting from the spin room:

Despite the absence of David Cameron from Thursday night's debate, the
Conservative party had a full spin operation in force, with three Tory ministers
and the party's head of communications Craig Oliver in attendance at the
screening for members of the press. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, former leader
of the house of commons William Hague and environment secretary Liz Truss were
all in what is dubbed 'the spin room' to give their verdict on the evening's
events. Hunt took the line - central to the Tory election campaign - that the
debate had been evidence of the ""coalition of chaos"" that would await the
British people if Ed Miliband became the next prime minister. ""[Nicola]
Sturgeon"" clearly got the better of [Ed Miliband],"" said Liz Truss. ""There was a
big contrast in the debate where the prime minister was there. He was clearly in
control of the situation."" ""It looked like the start of negotiations,"" she said.
A spokesperson for the party described the run-ins between Miliband and Sturgeon
as ""brilliant"", adding that if the two parties were to do a deal after the
election, ""we know who the stronger negotiator would be and it wouldn't be Ed
Miliband"". ""Do you think we saw the real David Cameron tonight?"" asked one
journalist. ""I think we saw the reality of what a chaotic coalition would look
like,"" said Truss. ""At the end of the debate we really saw it descend into chaos
and I think that's a picture of what the next five years would look like without
having a majority Conservative government""

On Natalie Bennett...

OH, to have been a fly on the Green MP Caroline Lucas's wall last night.
Received wisdom had it that Ed Miliband would be horribly squeezed in this third
debate, a lone establishment stooge overrun by insurgents. But if anyone was
drowned out, it was the Greens' Natalie Bennett. With three party leaders -
Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood and Bennett herself - selling a similar
anti-establishment, anti-austerity message there was only really room for one to
capture the imagination and the blunt truth is that it wasn't Bennett. When she
paid generous tributes to her predecessor Lucas, who went on to be the party's
sole MP, you wondered what would have happened had it been Lucas on the podium.

It wasn't all bad. When the inevitable immigration question arose,
Australian-born Bennett had powerful things to say in defence of free movement -
even if they felt a little rehearsed compared to Sturgeon's off-the-cuff
savaging of Nigel Farage. She had a deft bedside manner with audience members
and since English viewers hankering for a leftwing alternative can't vote SNP
perhaps it doesn't matter that their leader outshone her. Committed Greens will
be happy enough. But let's just say an outbreak of Bennettmania feels unlikely.

I've seen three Twitter sentiment analyses from the debate so far. All three
suggest Nicola Sturgeon was the most popular leader.

But, according to the Press Association, Nigel Farage was the most talked about
person on Twitter.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage proved yet again to be the big talking point on social
media during the BBC election debate this evening, as his comments on
immigration saw Twitter chatter spike.

The five leaders were mentioned in total more than 250,000 times on Twitter
during the course of the 90-minute programme.

Farage was the most discussed leader, with more than 112,000 mentions on Twitter
during the broadcast.

The Ukip leader saw a peak in discussions when he clashed with SNP leader Nicola
Sturgeon over immigration and accused the studio audience of being biased.

At that point Mr Farage was being mentioned more than 4,600 times per minute on
the social network.

Ed Miliband and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon were the second two most discussed
leaders, with more than 65,000 and 58,000 mentions respectively.

What a risk he took. They warned Ed Miliband was making a grave error to join a
line-up of the second division. Instead he stood there as the only prime
minister in the room - and one the great loser was the man who wasn't there.
Attack after attack rained down on the Tories, but their leader had run from the
field. Killer punch line, addressed to Cameron - ""If you think this election is
about leadership come and debate me - Let the people decide.""

Calm, relaxed, even laughing sometimes, he hit all the buttons. He attacked
failed markets, rogue employers and landlords, defusing attacks by frankly
admitting Labour didn't build enough housing and shouldn't have followed the US
into Iraq, reminding viewers it was he who prevented Cameron's Syrian adventure.
He stood by his deficit plans against the attractive anti-austerians. Best under
attack, he walloped a comeback against Farage's attack on Labour's immigration
record: ""You want to exploit people's fears instead of addressing them"".

His deadly opponent was Nicola Surgeon. He could have been easy meat for her
deft jibes, but with a powerful defence of the union he more than survived: he
might even have retrieved some Scottish votes.

Miliband's team will be rightly delighted. At every outing he grows in strength
and confidence. Once he thought presentation didn't matter - now he knows

On Nigel Farage...

Nigel Farage began with the swagger of a man who had just seen his party's
coffers replenished with a million pounds from Express publisher Richard
Desmond. Only Ukip will talk straight. We'll stand up to corporate giants, he
promised. He didn't say whether Richard Desmond would one of them. Farage
arrived once more as the insurgent. He huffed, he scoffed, framing himself as an
adult among children. But these days opponents see him coming. Name one cut you
would make, he demanded of Miliband. Miliband named three. You're lying, he spat
at Miliband when the Labour man accused him of seeking a privately funded NHS.
Miliband read his original quote back to him.

Thus, within half an hour, the swagger had dissipated. His citation of
immigration as root difficulty in housing and health failed to rouse the
audience. He reacted by complaining that the event had been politically rigged,
and was slapped down by David Dimbleby. My opponents are abusing me, he said,
moments after he himself had abused the audience, and soon his contradictions
seemed obvious to everyone in the vicinity. On a poor night, perhaps they were
obvious to him. Still, he carried on regardless. ""The real audience is sitting
at home,"" he said. Which was true enough. But Richard Desmond will want more for
his bucks than this.

Hung parliament question and closing statements - Snap verdict

Hung parliament question and closing statements - Snap verdict: The final
section saw another raw exchange, as Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon engaged in
their first proper coalition negotiations. The arguments that Miliband and
Sturgeon were deploying were much the same as those that Jim Murphy and Sturgeon
used in the three Scottish leaders' debates that have been held, but it was much
more interesting to see the two principals thrash it out. On the BBC now William
Hague is claiming that Sturgeon would be ""in the driving seat"", but actually
what the exchange revealed, I think, is how weak the SNP's negotiating position
actually is. The SNP has said that it would not form a coalition with Labour, or
agree a confidence and supply deal, without a deal on Trident, and Labour has
said that is not on offer. That means that, effectively, all the SNP could do is
support Labour on a confidence motion and then deal with everything else on a
case by case basis. And if the SNP are not prepared to let in the Tories, they
have to support Labour on a confidence motion. There was a hint of pleading in
Sturgeon's pitch at the end, and Miliband seemed to be in the stronger position.

Miliband also made the most of his closing statement, with his ""come and debate
me"" challenge. It sounded a bit cheesy, but people will remember it, and his
point is a robust one. Hague told the BBC just now that it was the broadcasters
who decided not to invite Cameron. That is disingenuous; Cameron was not invited
because he said he would refuse point-blank to come.

Miliband says there is a fundamental choice at the election. Do we carry on as
we are? Or do we try a different plan? Cameron refused to come and debate
tonight. But he has a message for Cameron.

Weir Group voted down on pay policy

Some late, breaking AGM news now and the shareholder spring is in full flow with
a big upset for engineering group Weir.

There was a 72.4% vote against Weir's remuneration policy.

The Glasgow engineer had two votes on pay, and the policy vote was also going to
be subject to close scrutiny given it included a share award which was not
linked to performance.

Weir had argued it had used this policy for US directors and said the pay for
the chief executive was down last year.

Ahead of the vote, Hermes, representing pension funds, had said: ""We are
recommending to clients that they vote against, due to the proposed award of
restricted shares which are not tied to performance targets.""

So it's back to the drawing board for Weir.

FTSE erases losses to finish marginally up on the day

On financial markets, London shares have managed to claw back some ground this
afternoon and the FTSE 100 erased early losses to finish virtually unchanged on
the day.

The London bluechips index is 2.5 points higher at 6,322.40. It had earlier
dropped sharply as markets around the world were dragged lower on disappointment
at the Japanese central bank's decision not to come up with any fresh stimulus

Back to AGM showdowns now and my colleague Julia Kollewe has been at the
Schroders AGM today, where shareholders registered their frustration with the
elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson, who ran the investment firm
for more than 14 years, to chairman.

Julia reports:

Nearly 15% voted against Dobson's re-election, and almost 12% voted against Lord
Howard of Penrith, the senior independent director who oversaw the move.

Hermes, which represents pension funds and had urged other investors to oppose
Dobson's promotion, voted against both.

It is a sizeable protest vote, given that the Schroders family owns 48% of the
shares. Some 4% of investors voted against the firm's remuneration report.

At the meeting in London, Lord Howard said the company was aware that it was
breaching corporate governance guidelines by making Dobson chairman, but
defended his promotion. ""We thought he was such a good and such an obvious
candidate,"" he said.

One of the biggest fund managers in the City, Schroders had consulted its 10
largest investors, and ""overall we received considerable, a lot of support""
although he admitted that there were ""some shareholders who had concerns"".
Howard said the company would continue to talk to them.

Royal London Asset Management voted against Schroders' pay policy and the
appointment of Dobson as chair. Its corporate governance manager Ashley Hamilton
Claxton said: ""Although Mr Dobson was successful in leading the company as CEO,
his appointment as chairman is inappropriate and in clear violation of the
corporate governance code.""

Graham Ruddickreports :

The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee has announced
it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors
of Green's Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil
their statutory duties.

BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. The
retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for 1 last March to
Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by
Chappell.

BHS's collapse has caused controversy because it has been saddled with a 571m
pension deficit despite Green collecting more than 580m in dividends, rent and
interest payments during his ownership, with Retail Acquisitions receiving
payments of more than 25m from BHS over the last 13 months.

Sticking with UK news for a moment, Jill Treanor and Julia Kollewe have been
following shareholder rebellions over pay today.

They have more details on the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals
failing to support a 25% pay rise for its chief executive, Flemming rnskov. The
report continues:

The increase in his salary to $1.7m (1.2m) means rnskov's bonuses are also
going up, a move which shareholders had been urged to protest against before the
annual meeting on Thursday.

The advisory pay vote squeezed through, as holders of 50.5% of the shares in the
Dublin-based but London-listed FTSE 100 company voted in favour - but if
deliberate abstentions were included, support for the board fell just below 50%.

It builds on the defiant mood in which the AGM season started earlier this month
when there were ""no votes"" at two FTSE 100 companies - BP and Smith & Nephew -
on the same day. Mining company Anglo American has also faced protests over pay,
with more than 40% of investors voting against its remuneration report last

Carney cites EU referendum risks as he notes UK slowdown

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been in Stockport this week and talking
about the EU referendum again.

Growth appears to be slowing ahead of June's vote, said Carney, who has
previously warned that Britain's economy could struggle to grow after a decision
to quit the European Union. The referendum itself posed a significant risk to
the economy, the Canadian said.

He told the Stockport Express newspaper : ""In the very short term the economy
appears to be slowing, probably related to issues around the referendum. One of
the responsibilities of the Bank of England is to manage risk and financial
stability.

""Risks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we
have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty.""

As we reported yesterday, the latest official figures showed UK economic growth
slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final
three months of 2015. But economists are divided over how much of the slowdown
could be blamed on the referendum.

half pint of beer while on duty (gasp!) is here.

In other UK news... the business select committee has launched a full inquiry
into the collapse of high street chain BHS.

They will investigate the sale of the business by Sir Philip Green for 1 last
year, what due diligence was done by the buyers, and whether the taxpayer is now
on the hook for BHS's pension bill.

Iain Wright MP,  committee chair,  says:

""The collapse of BHS brings misery and uncertainty for thousands of workers and
also places a potentially significant burden on the taxpayer in the form of
pension liabilities.

The sale and acquisition of BHS raises real questions about whether directors
acted in the best long-term interests of the company and their employees. Is
there too much of an incentive in the system for owners to asset-strip, take out
vast sums for personal gain, and then dump and run leaving the taxpayer to pick
up the tab when the company fails, rather than create value for the long-term?

Weak growth = no June rate hike

There's no chance of the US central bank raising interest rates while growth is
so weak, argues Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners.

According to Floyd, Americans can stop worrying that interest rates might rise
in June.

Despite the Fed's best efforts to leave the door open for a hike at the next
meeting, today's GDP data risks blowing it firmly shut. The data, showing a rise
of just 0.5% in the first quarter versus expectations of a rise of 0.7%,
undermines the more hawkish Fed tone from last night and does little to justify
an imminent raise.

Although the Fed dropped language acknowledging global risks it is worth noting
the next meeting is only 8 days before the next major global risk event, the
Brexit vote.

In light of the soft data and the looming referendum, a June hike is looking
increasingly unlikely with Janet Yellen's attempts to convince markets to the
contrary becoming largely futile. Traders will remain rightly sceptical.

Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, is
also concerned by the slowdown in US growth:

""The US economy hasn't run aground by any means, but it is navigating more
difficult domestic waters than three months ago. Growth has been weighed down by
weak performances in the manufacturing and energy sectors due to the strong
dollar and volatile oil prices. On top of this, consumer confidence has been
knocked recently, impacting retail sales.

""Although today's results clearly indicate a slowdown in growth, it's important
to remember that the US economy has still expanded. The labour market is in
reasonably good shape, and global risks seem to be slightly more muted than at
the start of the year. This will help support domestic momentum as the year
progresses.

block-time published-time 12.30pm BST

Sajid Javid's testimony: What we learned

Sajid Javid has been spoken of as a future prime minister. Even Forbes Magazine
got in on the act, saying it would be a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid
got the keys to Number 10.

But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of
Britain's steel industry. Today's session showed us that:

1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia.

He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last
month as Tata's board decided what to do with its UK steel plants.

He also insists it wouldn't have done any good, as his department has been
working behind the scenes since February. But we'll never know if Tata might
have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the
boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running.

Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by
Tata's decision - suggesting it didn't actually have a full grip on the crisis.

And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who
took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned.
Harsh game, politics.

2) It's all about the pensions.

Javid agreed with Tata's Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities
are crucial.

Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn't take them on, so Tata
and the government need to find a way of resolving the 15bn scheme, and its
deficit.

Javid claims that Tata's pension scheme is not a 'major risk' to taxpayers. But
that's not the same as saying taxpayers won't pay a penny....

And don't forget that Jha warned of economic and social disaster if the pension
problem isn't dealt with...

3) The government won't own more than 25% of British steel.

Javid is committed to taking a 25% stake in Tata UK, if it helps find a buyer.
But that's his limit - anything more would, in his view, be counterproductive.
That's a typically Thatcherite view, and means full nationalisation isn't on the
cards.

Q: Finally, what can you do to reassure customers and suppliers to keep working
with Tata steel at this time?

Sajid Javid says he has already written to all Tata's customers and suppliers,
and contacted the largest ones directly.

He has also asked Tata to give similar reassurances.

But the biggest comfort I can give is the action that we are prepared to take,
and how far we will go to get a deal.

That means customers and suppliers can look at this and say 'this business has a
long-term future'.

It's an ongoing process too - we need to keep reassuring people.

Javid concludes the session by insisting that the government is doing everything
it can, along with other partners such as the Welsh government and unions.

The Community union couldn't be more helpful if it tried, he concludes.

That's the end of the session.

block-time published-time 11.53am BST

Javid: We want a quick deal

Q: If a potential buyer says it needs nine months to agree a deal, but Tata
insist on a quick deal, would you step in with a bridging loan?

I'm not going to rule anything out, Javid replies, but the focus is to find a
commercial operator quickly.

A nine-month process isn't in anyone's interest.

Q: You have offered to take a 25% stake in Tata UK. Is that your maximum limit?

Javid says his offer of 25% co-ownership was designed to show potential buyers
that he's serious about getting a deal.

But the 25% figure is important - if you go over that, the government would be a
significant shareholder, and too closely involved.

Q: How long would you be prepared to hold this stake before looking to exit?

Javid says it's too early to say.

block-time published-time 11.49am BST

Q: Unions have told us they would favour scrapping the lesser duty rule, in
favour of a new solution just for the steel sector. Is this under consideration?

Javid says he still supports the lesser duty rule [ this is the rule that
prevents higher tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel ]

The lesser duty rule works, Javid insists. Its intention is to stop dumping or
provide compensation.

If we scrapped it, we would have spent an extra 500m on the solar industry for
example [because the lesser duty rule covers a range of industries, not just
steel]

Q: Do you believe Tata are a responsible seller, given they didn't fully brief
you about their plans for a quick sale?

Yes, Javid replies, based on the conversations I'd had with them. They have
approached this issue responsibly.

Q: Is there timeline appropriate? They are talking about finding a buyer within
weeks, but this will take months.

Tata are losing money every day, so they can't have unlimited time. But it is
important that they do everything possible to find a responsible buyer.

I have every reason to believe that when they promise to be responsible, that
will be reflected in the timeline, Javid  hints.

MPs are questioning whether Sajid Javid is really doing enough to help the steel
industry.

I will do everything in my power to help, but I cannot influence the price of

Q: But what about tariffs? Should the EU move faster to identify problems?

Speed of action is an issue, Javid replies -- that's why I called a meeting last
year to look at the issue of dumping. Europe must move faster.

Reminder: Javid actually blocked a measure to impose higher tariffs on Chinese
steel imports....

Q: What is your working assumption about the pension liabilities, if there is a

to take on Tata's pension liabilities.

It's a big scheme, with 130,000 members, and it's relatively expensive.

Q: So might the public purse be left 'holding the baby'?

No, Javid replies. Discussions are already underway to finding a solution.

Q: What top three lessons can we learn from the Scottish government's deal to

it only involved 300 jobs.

Q: But surely we can learn lessons from Scotland's speed of response? (they
brokered a deal which say Tata sell the site to Liberty House ).

help workers to keep their skills 'fresh', or reskill if needed.

Javid insists that the Redcar plant didn't have a viable future, and no serious
offers. So given the uncertainty facing workers, he wanted to quickly arrange a
package to help them retrain and find new jobs.

Committee chairman Iain Wright isn't impressed, telling the secretary of state
that he should have allowed Redcar to be mothballed.

the pressure not to release commercially sensitive decisions.

He points out that minister Anna Soubry didn't rule out nationalisation, but
then adds:

Rarely is nationalisation a solution - the best companies are in private hands.

Q: You're doing it again - 'rarely' is not a decisive word. It doesn't suggest a
clear-cut plan to what's been unfolding.

Javid repeats that he is under control. It has taken time for Tata to release
info about its own plans, and the government has been reacting and adding its
own detail.

Javid: I wasn't blindsided by Tata

Q: Isn't the truth that you were blindsided by Tata, which is why you set off to
Australia leaving no-one in London who could deal with this crisis?

No, Javid insists. Tata is a large global business, so people in every
management layer don't always have all the information about what's happening.

He denies that a better early warning system would have helped.

Q: It looked like you were on the back foot after the Mumbai meeting, in panic
mode and scrambling around to get the initiative.

Javid denied that he should have flown to Mumbai for the board meeting - that
would have been far too late. It might have made a great photo opportunity, but
it wouldn't have helped.

Instead, our work in the weeks before the meeting were crucial. And the
government couldn't have shared some information because it was legally
sensitive - announcing it could have made the situation worse.

Q: So when the Tata board met in Mumbai in late March, were you convinced that

Yes, says Javid.

No, says Javid. But he was surprised by the speed at which Tata was looking to
sell up.

Q: Frankly, secretary of state, I don't understand why you weren't in Mumbai,
says Iain Wright.

Javid repeats that he had been shocked to learn in February that Port Talbot
could close, but he had then begun looking for a buyer. So he was startled by
newspaper reports that the board decided to settle the issue 'within weeks'

That is not what we agreed with Tata, and that's not what they are not planning
to do.

could return if needed - as he did.

Sajid Javid has arrived, flanked by two senior officials.

Iain Wright, BIS committee chair, goes first:

Q: You told the House on 11 April that Tata were seriously considering closing
Port Talbot.

The CEO of Tata UK has questioned that this morning [ earlier ] - so who
actually told you, and when?

Javid says that Tata India (so not the UK branch) told him in mid-February that
they were considering shutting Port Talbot and focusing on the rest of their UK
operations.

We then worked intensively to try to persuade Tata to keep funding their
operations, and embark on a turnaround plan.

But it became clear that the board might not accept that, so we began
considering whether an alternative owner could be found instead - and
considering what we could do to assist

Q: What did you do between mid-February and the Mumbai board meeting at the end
of March when the decision to sell up was taken?

Javid says he asked the company if there was anything we could do that would
prevent them from closing Port Talbot. And the short answer was no.

There were things they wanted us to do for the rest of the business - but I kept
my focus on saving Port Talbot. So we began considering whether another buyer
could be found.

Tata is a global producer, not just a UK one, so there may be another company
who could take their operations on.

Here is Newsnight's report on why the polls got the election wrong.

block-time published-time 1.04pm GMT

In an article for the Times's Red Box daily political email Freddie Sayers and
Stephan Shakespeare from YouGov think there is a solution to the problem
identified by the election polling inquiry report. Here's an extract.

The headline finding of today's report chimes with our own internal
investigation, namely that the main cause of the error last May was sampling. In
other words, the samples of people who were answering surveys from all the
different polling companies did not adequately represent the voting public. They
may have looked representative in terms of age, gender, income and so on but
they had too few Tories in them.

In particular, the groups we were measuring contained too many politically
engaged people. For most of our work this is not a concern - if you want to find
out what toothpaste people prefer, it makes no difference whether they take an
interest in politics or not. But for an election poll, the very fact that they
agree to answer a survey may make them more likely to be political...

No, the future of opinion polling is not going back to door knocking - it must
be online, and more specifically mobile. YouGov has an online panel who answer
regular surveys in exchange for cash and prizes (600,000 people in the UK)
including plenty of non-political people who simply do it for the money. Because
we have detailed profile data on all of them we can identify the non-political
ones and make sure to include enough of them in future election surveys. Random
samples of strangers - telephone or face to face - can never make this
adjustment and so are vulnerable to effects they can't even measure.

The way to get more ""normal"" young people taking part - a large part of the
polling error in 2015 - is surely to build a mobile-based experience that make
taking part easier and more social, a more natural part of their online lives.
We are already doing this. We need to innovate faster to keep pace, not pretend
the internet never happened.

In a post on his PoliticalBetting blog  Mike Smithson says Gallup in the US has
given up doing state-of-the-party polling, and instead focuses on other
indicators that may be more revealing.

After a lacklustre performance with its voting numbers at Whl12 the firm took
the strategic decision to drop that aspect for Whl16 and focus on elements that
can often give better pointers to election outcomes.

""What do independent voters really think of Trump? Are views of Hillary really
on the decline after taking a fair bruising in the first phase of the effort to
get the nomination? Could Sanders really have an appeal?""

The key political questioning by Gallup and many other US pollsters is is on
perceptions of favourability which I now regard as the best leader rating
format.

Andrew Rawnsley made a similar point i n his Observer column on Sunday.

I have often argued here that the headline numbers of the polls are not as
important as the key details, especially the parties' ratings for leadership and
economic competence. Had I paid more heed to my own advice, I ought to have seen
that David Cameron would be back in Downing Street.

You can read all today's Guardian politics coverage here.

As for the rest of the papers, here is  the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must
reads, and here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today's politics stories.

And here are three articles I found particularly interesting.


         Oliver Wright and Nigel Morris in the Independent say the government
          has been criticised for increasingly passing laws through secondary
          legislation.


Statutory instruments (SIs) were first introduced at the end of the 1940s as a
way of freeing up parliamentary time by allowing procedural changes to laws to
be made without a full debate in a vote in the Commons.

Over the years their use has mushroomed from just 1,100 in 1982 to more than
3,000 today. Much of the increase took place after the Coalition came to power
in 2010.

But what concerns critics is not just the number of SIs being introduced but the
significance of the legislative changes that they are introducing.

Since the 2015 election the SIs that have been introduced by the Government
include changes to the electoral register that could result in more than a
million people being denied the chance to vote, allow fracking under national
parks and heritage sites and withdraw winter fuel payments from British
pensioners living abroad.

         The Times (paywall) says David Cameron has been warned that holding an
          EU referendum in June would damage the Tories' prospects in the local
          and London mayoral elections.


David Cameron has been warned that holding an EU referendum in June increases
the chances of Conservative defeats in May's council and London mayoral
elections.

Cabinet ministers said that a mid-summer plebiscite would inevitably split local
Tory parties and draw campaigners away from the elections the previous month.
""Cameron's been told we could lose London if he goes for June,"" said one
well-placed figure.

Zac Goldsmith, a Eurosceptic, is particularly vulnerable to a timetable that
will ensure the EU dominates political debate during his campaign to replace
Boris Johnson in City Hall. ""A June referendum doesn't work for Zac at any level
at all,"" said one of his advisers.


         Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says David Cameron
          is successful because he understands voter apathy.


All politicians understand Yes, No and Undecided. Only the winners understand
Don't Much Care. Mr Cameron communicates crisply because he knows most people
only tune in for a few minutes a day. He does not lose himself in marginalia
that no swing voter will ever notice. Rousing a nation through force of
personality is something leaders do in films: the real art of politics is
accepting apathy and bending it to your purposes.

And it all starts with the realisation that apathy is not a type of sickness...

Apathy is a respectable disposition in a country where, for most people most of
the time, life is tolerable-to-good. There are nations with much hotter
politics, and they tend to send refugees to tedious old Britain...

Apathetic Britons are not waiting to be redeemed. They just have lives to get on
with. Not only are they apolitical; they rouse themselves to vote every five
years precisely to stop hot heads and crusaders from running their country. They
like Mr Cameron because he governs well enough to save them having to think
about politics. He is prime minister because someone has to be.

On the subject of opinion polls, the Press Association has published an analysis
of the latest polling figures saying Labour is doing worse at this point in the
electoral cycle than at any time since the second world war. This is from the
Press Association's Ian Jones.

Labour has failed to achieve any bounce in the polls since Jeremy Corbyn became
leader and the party has not performed this badly in the aftermath of any
election since the second world war.

It is currently trailing the Conservatives by an average of eight points.

This is the biggest poll deficit recorded by Labour eight months after an
election defeat since regular opinion polls began in Britain in the late 1940s,
analysis by the Press Association shows.

At this stage in the last parliament, the party was ahead of the Tories by an
average of five points.

And eight months after losing the 1992 election, Labour had opened up a lead of
10 points.

The last time the party was still polling behind the Conservatives this long
after an election defeat was in 1988, when it trailed by five points.

But it is impossible to find any record since the Second World War of a gap
bigger than eight points at this stage in any electoral cycle.

To add to Labour's woes, the party has failed to come first in any opinion poll
published since the Tories won the general election in May 2015.

Some pollsters have warned that Labour's current ratings may even be too high.

Commenting on the latest poll from ICM, which shows the Tories on 40% and Labour
on 35%, ICM director Martin Boon said: ""This may be overstating Labour strength.
35% is probably too high. We can see in the small print of this poll that we've
still got too many respondents who recall voting Labour.""

ICM has adjusted its methods since the general election in an attempt to better
reflect the views of people who decline to reveal their intention.

Labour's current poll deficit of eight points is not the biggest the party has
experienced while in opposition. The Tories enjoyed a 10-point lead just 12
months after winning the 1959 election, for example.

A gap of eight points has never opened up this quickly, however.

Prof John Curtice, the psephologist who is president of the British Polling
Council, was on BBC News earlier talking about the election poll inquiry. He
explained that one of the problems was that Labour supporters are easier to
find, and that Conservative supporters are more reluctant to answer questions
from pollsters.

So does that mean polls are a waste of time, he was asked. No, he replied.

Can I just point you to the experience of the Oldham West byelection last
autumn, which was an opinion poll free contest. And we had constant speculation
during that about how Ukip were coming up close behind Labour, it was going to
be a really bad result for Jeremy Corbyn etc etc. And we ended up discovering
the Labour vote went up by 10 percentage points and they were way ahead of Ukip.
So the absence of opinion polls does not necessarily produce better media
reporting or better coverage of the campaign.

The truth is, the answer is to try and improve the way opinion polls are done.
And there is no doubt, given that the problem is an issue of sampling, that will
not necessarily be easy to solve. But it is certainly worthwhile trying to solve
that problem and [better] than simply relying on the prognostications of
politicians and journalists as to where the election stands.

Inflation nudges up to 0.2% in December

Inflation has nudged slightly up. This is from the Press Association.

Inflation edged up to its highest level for nearly a year last month as a sharp
rise in air fares over the Christmas holidays offset falling food and clothing
prices.

But official figures showed inflation remaining at a historic low, with the
consumer price index (CPI) falling to zero over the whole of 2015 - the lowest
annual reading since records began in 1950.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said CPI rose to 0.2% in December, up
from 0.1% in November and the highest reading since January 2015.

Air fares soared by 46% between November and December due to the seasonal rise
in flight costs over the festive season, marking the biggest leap for 13 years,
with long-haul flights in particular impacted - although the ONS said inflation
readings for flights can be volatile.

Prices on the forecourts continued to fall, with petrol down by 3.4p a litre,
although this was less than the 6.1p drop seen a year earlier.

James Tucker, head of CPI at the ONS, said: ""Today's small rise in CPI was
mainly down to air fares and motor fuels, partially offset by falls in alcohol
and food prices.

""While this modest rise takes CPI to its highest level for 11 months, it is
still at historically low levels.""

David Mundell, the Scotland secretary, has said there is a ""strong case"" for
staging the EU referendum this June - assuming Cameron wins the right deal for
the UK in Brussels.

Mundell told reporters in Edinburgh on Tuesday that Scotland's experience with a
long, drawn-out independence referendum - which began in early 2012 and end with
a vote in September 2014, made it clear that a quick, short campaign was
preferable. That was an ""inordinate length of time,"" Mundell said.

Hinting he had advised Cameron to hold the referendum quickly, Mundell added:
""Most people engaged with the referendum really in those final four, six weeks
of it when it was imminent, I think there's isn't an argument against having it
in June. I think, in fact, that there's a strong argument to have it in June.""

One factor which may also have heavily influenced Mundell's thinking is that the
long time period for the Scottish referendum enabled the pro-independence
campaign to substantially gain ground, closing the gap with the pro-UK vote from
20 points to 10 points.

Polls on EU membership show the vote in England is neck and neck, with some
giving the Brexit vote a lead, while in Scotland, there is a clear majority in
favour of remaining in.

The Scottish secretary denied that a referendum so close to the Scottish
parliament elections on 5 May, when Welsh assembly and English council elections
also take place, would exhaust the political parties and prevent full debate on
the EU in Scotland.

With dates in September and October also under scrutiny, Nicola Sturgeon, the
first minister, warned last week against a June poll, fearing that was not long
enough to give Cameron and the pro-EU campaign enough time to make the case.

Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government's Europe minister, indicated a June poll
would be resisted by ministers in Edinburgh.

""Both the Scottish parliament elections and the EU referendum are vitally
important events for Scotland - and neither campaign should be drowned out by
the other,"" Yousaf said.

""As the first minister made clear last week a June referendum restricts the
opportunity to make the case for remaining in the EU and shows disrespect to the
elections taking place in Scotland, Wales and London in May.""

Much of the reporting of the general election last year was shaped by opinion
polls suggesting that Labour and the Conservatives were neck and neck and that a
hung parliament was inevitable. As we now know, those assumptions were wrong.
The polling industry commissioned an inquiry into what went wrong and the
results are out today.

My colleague Tom Clark has written an overnight story on its conclusions. Here
it is.

Related:  General election opinion poll failure down to not reaching Tory voters

And here is how it starts.

The long-awaited postmortem into what wrong with the opinion polls in last
year's general election is published on Tuesday, and it points the finger at the
pollsters' failure to reach enough Conservative voters.

Patrick Sturgis, a professor of research methodology at Southampton University,
who has headed a team of nine experts undertaking an independent review for the
British Polling Council, said that ""the emerging upshot is that the companies
are going to have to be more imaginative and proactive in making contact with -
and giving additional weight to - those sorts of respondents that they failed to
reach in adequate numbers in 2015.""

But it is not all hopeless for the pollsters. On the Today programme Prof
Sturgis was asked if we were looking at the death of polling. Emphatically not,
he replied.

No, I strongly suspect not because although the result was wrong, and that
always is the worst thing to get wrong, actually the polls were pretty bang on
in terms of the smaller parties. They got the Greens, they got the SNP surge,
they got the collapse of the Lib Dems - those were all exactly right. You could
look at it in some ways and say it was a bit unfortunate that they were three
points over on Labour, three points under on the Conservatives. And that was a
bit of a perfect storm for them.

The fact is that the polls are far and away the best way of trying to figure out
what the election is going to be. We probably need to recognise that they are
not infallible. Even if we moved to the most expensive random survey you could
possible imagine, there would still be a chance that would get it wrong.

I will be posting more on this throughout the day.

Here is the agenda for the day.

time people leap up from the rows of benches to shout out their lines, as if
they are audience and actors both. All is loosely controlled, it seems, by a man
who sits on a kind of throne. There appear to be two protagonists. They quarrel
noisily with one another. The chief of these sometimes emphasises his point by
removing his spectacles and brandishing them. He leans with masculine threat on
a highly decorated wooden box that sits on a table. The other also has a box to
lean on, but does so with less sense of virile assurance. In front of the boxes
on the table lies a golden staff, seemingly an object of some significance. All
of this carries on over a steady background of noise: exaggerated laughter,
hoots and honks, cries and shrieks expressive of agreement, or disagreement, or
derision, or spite. It is compelling as ritual, though the script can appear
thin and hackneyed.

The debating chamber of the House of Commons resembles a theatre; it is a ""place
for looking"" ( theatron ). Since the televising of proceedings in 1989 it has
had, at least potentially, the whole nation as audience; MPs have had to
remember to compose their faces when they are in shot. We may find ourselves
cynical at the yelling and point-scoring - more panto or pub brawl than
Shakespeare. Nonetheless, it is people engaged in dialogue. It is debate; it is
conflict; it is spoken; it is embodied; it is enfolded in ritual by virtue of
the space it inhabits, the objects that are associated with it and by a
meticulous ordering of proceedings. Politics is theatre.

It is debate; it is conflict; it is spoken; it is embodied; it is enfolded in
ritual by virtue of the space it inhabits

It is surely because politics and theatre share so many qualities that, of all
the artforms that are now reflecting back to us the world that we live in, it is
theatre that is most adroitly and directly addressing its politics (though of
course it would be naive to suggest that any artistic gesture is entirely
untinged by the political). Unlike music, dance and visual art it is theatre's
wordiness - the fact that it likes to place people in a room and have them talk,
and disagree - that makes it the artform most closely allied to politics. And
compared to other ""talky"" artforms, TV drama and film, theatre can react to
events in the world quickly and cheaply, and has fewer gatekeepers,
commissioners and funders to become anxious on its behalf. Unlike poems or
novels or essays, consumed, for the most part, in private, theatre involves
bodies on stage performing mimetic actions in front of its audience, who are
also there, in person. Theatre is the particular artform that shows us people
doing things and asks us to reflect on these actions: the word for ""doing"" in
Greek is ""drama"". In addition, theatre's rituals require something more than a
casual engagement from its audience. Playwright David Greig says: ""Theatre is
where we gather in one place to go through something together in an activated,
listening mode. And then you go out with your pals and talk about it afterwards.
Fifty per cent of the play is watching the show; 50% of it is its echo.""

Politics runs through British theatre quite naturally, from Shakespeare's
uneasily lying, crown-wearing heads to David Hare 's activation of the debates
on the invasion of Iraq and Laura Wade's skewering of the entitled establishment
in Posh. Now, as a general election approaches, theatre in Britain seems
especially alert to politics and the political. Even the night of 7 May itself
is the subject of a drama, James Graham 's The Vote, set in a polling station
during the two hours before it closes. On election night it will be played on
the stage of the Donmar Warehouse in London in real time, and broadcast
simultaneously by Channel 4. Graham himself has been one of a number of
playwrights and artistic directors who have taken on politics directly in recent
years. He is author, too, of the celebrated This House (2012), set amid the hung
parliament and tiny Labour majority of 1974-79, and Privacy (2014), which took a
line of thinking about the politics of mass surveillance and extended it to

Like The Vote, Privacy was directed by Josie Rourke at the Donmar, where she
also recently staged Coriolanus. S he says that these productions represent, for
her, a trilogy of approaches to democracy, ""exploring similar ideas through
different apertures"". Last year at the Almeida theatre, Mike Bartlett 's play
King Charles III speculated on what would happen if a restive and
interventionist successor to the Queen refused to sign off a piece of
legislation. This winter, the Royal Court staged a play called Hope by Jack
Thorne about the local authority cuts handed down by communities secretary Eric
Pickles: a surprisingly uplifting drama, with Paul Higgins playing a deputy
council leader assailed by civic dilemmas. At the Tricycle theatre in London,
its artistic director Indhu Rubasingham is directing Multitudes, John
Hollingworth 's play set in Bradford on the eve of a Conservative party
conference as a liberal British Muslim prepares to deliver a speech; his partner
is a convert to Islam and his daughter is a radical. Southwark Playhouse
recently staged Juliet Gilkes Romero's Upper Cut, about the politics of black
representation in the Labour party. These plays are simply a handful (staged in
the city where I live, London) of those that have recently put politicians or
the political process on stage - the most limited definition of the idea of the
""political play"" available.

***

Theatre is politics, in its blood and bones. In Athens, its birthplace, theatre
was deeply entrenched in the religious and civic calendar of the city-state.
This was a talkative city - where Socrates acted out philosophy through talking
with people he encountered in the streets, and where Plato memorialised his
teacher's thinking in texts written in the form of dialogues. ( Virginia Woolf
wrote of the younger man's ""dramatic genius"".) After the reforms of Cleisthenes
in 508, it was a radically democratic city. Free men, a quorum of 6,000, were
entitled to vote on detailed matters of state in the assembly, held normally on
the Pnyx, a hill not far from the theatre of Dionysus, which itself stood on the
southern slope of the Acropolis, hunkered down beneath the great temple of
Athena. Anyone, provided they had served two years in the military, could speak
in the assembly (though veterans of open meetings will know that in such
situations, those with the confidence to do so tend to be a self-selecting
group). Rhetoric, the act of persuasive speech, was the great Athenian skill and
the route to political power. Open-air, noisy, talk-filled gatherings were part
of life, if you were born a free man; the streets and squares of the city were a
kind of stage. In Republic, Plato has Socrates speak out critically about this
urban, verbal rough and tumble. He describes the people of Athens ""in the
assembly or law court or theatre"" and ""the boos and applause of their criticism
or praise (excessive in both cases) of whatever is being said"". He asks: ""How do
you think a young man's heart, as they say, will be affected?"" Don't you
suppose, he adds, that such a listener will be ""swept away at the mercy of the
current?""

The assembly, the law court and the theatre were, this passage tells us,
activated alike by persuasion and emotion: powerful and dangerous things. They
were also activated by intellectual deliberation and decision-making. This
quality of deliberativeness was, as Edith Hall points out in Greek Tragedy
(2010), regarded by Aristotle as a vital constituent of theatre. Though all
surviving Greek tragedies except one were set in the deep (and pre-democratic)
past, scenes of political decision-making run through them - from the
dramatisation of votes being cast in The Eumenides, the last play of Aeschylus's
Oresteia trilogy, to Antigone's determination, in Sophocles's play, to bury her
brother's body (and her uncle's decision to punish her). The members of Athens's
state council (the 500 men, selected by lot, who haggled over the detail of
policy) witnessed this fictional deliberation from the best seats: the front
rows were allotted to them. Plenty of Aristophanes's comedies, which were set in
the contemporary world, satirise or otherwise evoke the political process: in
Ecclesiazusae (which you could translate loosely as ""Women in Parliament""), the
lead character Praxagora rehearses a speech she is planning to give, disguised
as a man, in the assembly - metatheatrically transporting the audience across
the city to the Pnyx.

Just as democracy in Athens was radically participatory - mass voting, important
positions of state chosen by lot - so was its theatre. Over the 70-year span of
the Greek tragedies that survive (472-401BC), the men who made the plays
(producing, writing, performing them) were members of the Athenian public, and
many of them what we would call amateurs. Hall calls it ""community theatre"",
noting that ""many of the spectators would have performed in a tragic chorus at
some stage in their lives, probably when they were young men; numerous others
would be proudly watching one of their brothers, sons, nephews, grandsons or
neighbours performing"". At the annual Athenian festival, the Great Dionysia,
three tragedians presented work (a trilogy each plus a rumbustious ""satyr
play""), as did five comic authors (a play apiece).

This was not some archaic version of the Edinburgh festival or Latitude: it was
deeply embedded in the heart of state politics, imperialism, warfare and
religion, in ways that we might find unfamiliar or uncomfortable. The festival
was timed according to the start of the sailing season, so that Athens could
welcome her allies. At the start of the festival, Dionysus, the god of wine and
theatre, who sent you ""beside yourself"" and thus, perhaps, capable of taking on
the characteristics of another person, was ritually reintroduced to his theatre,
supposedly re-enacting his first journey to the city from the village of
Eleutherae on the Boeotian border.

The next day came a procession, led by a virgin girl. Men carrying Dionysus's
ritual phalluses brought up the rear; the metics (resident foreigners) joined
the procession dressed in red. Sacrifices were made at the various city
sanctuaries. Hall writes in her new book, Introducing the Ancient Greeks : ""The
sanctuary of Dionysus must have resembled a massive sunlit abattoir attached to
a barbecue. It would have resounded with the bellowing and beating of frightened
animals, been awash with their blood, and reeked of carcasses and roasting
meat."" The theatre itself, before the plays began, was purified by libations
made by the city's 10 generals. The revenue accumulated by Athens from her
imperial possessions was displayed to the audience and, during the Peloponnesian
wars, suits of armour were ceremonially presented to the sons of the war dead.
And then the plays began: four plays in a day from each of three tragedians, and
comedies (the performance patterns of these varied over the years). Judges, who
had been selected by lot from across the cities' demes (villages or districts)
made their choice and the victorious playwright was crowned with ivy and led in
procession to a noisy and drunken party.

So far, so unlike a night at the local rep. Nonetheless, theatre, however
faintly, still retains the lingering and ineradicable sense that it is the civic
artform par excellence. No art that is made can avoid reflecting its time and
the particular political, social and economic circumstances of its making.
Theatre, however, is the artform that does this most easily and consciously.
Tragedy, Aristotle wrote, arouses pity - meaning the ability to feel from
another's perspective. Politics, at its best and most powerful, is also about
empathy and pity, asking us to think about not just what is right for me, but
what is right for the community - for the polis.

***

Politics as a subject for plays comes and goes. At the moment, playwrights and
artistic directors seem especially keen to mount plays that deal with political
life, and audiences keen to absorb them. Why should this be? It is perhaps, as
much as anything, to do with a youngish, newish generation of artistic directors
- among them Lorne Campbel l at Northern Stage, Vicky Featherstone at the Royal
Court and Rufus Norris, about to take on the National Theatre - for whom
political awakening came under the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, and
whose programmes suggest they are people for whom politics is not something to
be left at the door of the theatre when they come to work. Norris describes the
theatre that he is about to take over from Nicholas Hytner as ""the national
debating chamber"" - as it has been under Hytner, whose own productions of the
classics, in particular, tended to speak to the political moment (his first,
Henry V, in 2003, made much of convoluted justifications for making war, for
example, and his Hamlet, 2010, emphasised Elsinore as a heavily surveilled
society). Norris believes it is an entirely natural process. ""This is a centre
of creative self-expression,"" he says of the National, ""and it is inevitably
political if people care about what they are saying."" Theatre took on a
particular role during the Scottish referendum: for example, the National
Theatre of Scotland's The Great Yes, No, Don't Know Five-minute Theatre Show
took place on 23 June, in the runup to the 18 September vote, in locations
around Scotland, consisting of plays - many written by non-professionals -
exploring the ideas about Scotland's future. Featherstone, founding artistic
director of the National Theatre of Scotland, says: ""If you believe that the
theatre is a place to ask questions about the world we're in - and potentially
make changes - the work is always political.""

Perhaps there is something else going on, too. Public discourse at the moment
seems especially fraught and especially narrow. The broadcast political
interview seems caught in an ever-decreasing circle of aggression in delivery
and timidity in content. The editor of the BBC's Newsnight, Ian Katz, wrote last
year in the Financial Times that ""for the most part interviews with
frontbenchers are an arid, ritualised affair: interviewer suggests politician's
policy or position is flawed/inconsistent/unfunded; politician denies the
charge/ignores the question/suggests that real people in his or her constituency
care about something different. They repeat this a few times, typically for
somewhere between four and 10 minutes. The interviewee considers it a success if
he or she hasn't said something that will attract the ire of their party's PR
capos. The interviewer considers it a success if the exchange has produced 'a
line', though more often than not it will be the line the politician came to
deliver."" There is no room for doubt; no room for acknowledging that the other
side might be half-right. Nuance is stamped out and hesitation is interpreted as
weakness. It is often said by Westminster journalists that individual
politicians - Ed Miliband, say, or George Osborne - are intelligent and
penetrating conversationalists in private. Switch on a microphone, however, and
all this is ironed out to flatness. Meantime, since the rise of Twitter, the
stakes for public discourse have become higher. Our digital public space -
though it can also bring enormous benefits - can feel frightening and dangerous,
as the virtual bullies, like so many Furies, gather to punish verbal wrongdoing,
actual or perceived.

Occasionally the political interview or confrontation provides its own
excitement, if you like watching a scrap, and particularly explosive interviews
might reveal intriguing aspects of a politician's character by way of collateral
damage. But the content, as opposed to the delivery, is often unilluminating.
Some politicians understand and accept this. Earlier this year Miliband said:
""Watching me and David Cameron shout at each other once a week on prime
minister's questions isn't very enlightening for anybody, let's be frank about
it. It probably massively puts people off politics ... I'm not sure it's made
much difference to the sum of human knowledge."" Thus a tiny chink appeared in
the political fourth wall. It is not theatre but politics that can sometimes
seem to exist in a parallel, unreal universe. In this universe of politics, only
certainty can be expressed. And yet everyone knows that certainty, where it
exists, is dangerous; in practical terms, it is usually a flight of the
imagination.

What theatre has that politics lacks is a quality of the uncanny. The fact that
the person before you has (usually) adopted the characteristics of another
already means that the experience of it is pushed away from certainty. In the
first tragedy that survives - Aeschylus's The Persians - the Queen of Persia
summons, with incantations, the ghost of the former king, Darius. Perhaps all
theatre retains the faint trace of this notion of raising spirits, the
spookiness of the lifting on and taking off of a personality and a mask. Another
way of expressing this is to say that theatre is first cousin to poetry (they
share a grandparent in the epics of Homer, which are both poetic and dramatic).
Theatre, like poetry, is not a form that flourishes under conditions of
certainty. It prefers ambiguity and questions. It prefers metaphor and curious
connections. It is, in this way, simultaneously uncanny and true to life.

***

Politics in theatre goes way beyond plays about politics. When Phyllida Lloyd
directed women-only productions of Julius Caesar (2012) and Henry IV (2014) at
the Donmar, she was making a political statement about the fact that theatre
itself, though the most humanly representative of the artforms (in that it
involves people doing and speaking in front of other people) rarely accurately
represents the Britain that it purports to show. Her all-female casts were the
most obvious quality of the productions, but, in fact, the company was also
racially diverse, drawn from a variety of social backgrounds, and contained
women of various body types. ""Who is there on the stage can be as much a
provocation as the text itself,"" she says. She has now undertaken not to direct
work in which women form less than half the cast. This has changed the nature of
her career. ""I've had to walk away from plays in development where I haven't
felt it was my right to ask the writer to write differently, and it has almost
collapsed my relationship with opera,"" she says.

What, for me, was remarkable about watching the productions was not only the way
the actors seemed unlocked by the huge, generous Shakespeare roles they could at
last take on, but also the carelessly expansive way they occupied space,
physically. I hadn't truly seen before how much room men take up; women minimise
themselves. Lloyd acknowledges that playing to small audiences in London's most
exclusive theatre is unlikely to cause a revolution. The real power, she says,
is in taking the work into prisons and schools, and not on screen but in person.
""A call to arms is always going to be more potent in the flesh. Why do MPs knock
door to door?""

At the Lyric theatre in Hammersmith, London, Sean Holmes, the artistic director,
has recently come to the end of a season in which he worked with the same
ensemble of actors. Announcing the experiment in 2013, he said: ""With a company
split equally, there will always be five women and five men on stage. There will
always be black actors on stage. There will always be a disabled actor on
stage."" The point was both political (about representation) and artistic (the
predetermined ensemble prevented them, or rather freed them, from interpreting
texts literally). In reality, the two aspects were inextricable.

It쟧s not theatre but politics that can sometimes seem to exist in a쟰arallel,
unreal universe

There is a young generation of theatre artists for whom art and politics, or art
and activism, have cohered. Harry Giles, who is based in Edinburgh, says that he
is ""sceptical about the category of artists and activists"", for ""everybody is
engaged in political and creative acts, every day"". One of his recent works is
titled Everything I Bought and How It Made Me Feel - a stage show drawing on a
year-long blog in which he catalogued all the purchases he made and the emotions
he experienced on doing so. He believes theatre can change people, in that it
can ""be part of a person's means of liberation from one form of oppression or
another. It is about awareness; it is about feeling"". Slung Low is a company in
Leeds that grows its own vegetables, in compost reclaimed from a former
marijuana farm, in old baths donated by local plumbers. (Hot vegetable soup
comes with entry to shows under the chilly railway arches, which are ""pay what
you can afford"".) After the election it will mount, with Sheffield People's
Theatre, a show called Camelot: The Shining City, a reworking of the King Arthur
story, which will examine what it means to be English. It will be performed in
the open by 150 members of the community, using a mythical story from the past
to illuminate the present. It sounds, just for a moment, very Greek.

It is possible that an inquiry about political plays is really, in the end, an
inquiry about form: that the political in theatre lies at least as much in its
structures as its content. In any case, as the artistic director of the Almeida,
Rupert Goold, says, many ""political plays"" in fact suffer from the same ills as
the politics they describe. In other words, they provide only a comforting
certainty; they are ""chillingly normative, bracingly confirming what the
audience thought they believed - that the financial sector needs punishing; that
climate change is bad"". At the Royal Court, Zinnie Harris 's new play, How to
Hold Your Breath, is political in its content, in that it considers mass
migration and the breakdown of societies after economic collapse. Perhaps its
most sharply political quality, however, is that its central character is a
woman (played by Maxine Peake ) who holds together the geography and
architecture of the play, whose domestic and sexual arrangements the audience is
invited to accept and not to judge, and who is, in a sense ""everyman"". Sarah
Kane 's play Blasted (recently revived as part of the continuing Sarah Kane
season at the Sheffield Crucible) was widely interpreted at the time of its
premiere in 1995 as being ""about"" the war in the Balkans. But what is even more
striking than the ugly and strange things that happen in the Leeds hotel room in
which the play is set (rape, a baby being eaten) is the manner in which the
whole dramatic structure of it comes crashing down. Having become verbally more
and more terse, it ends with a series of short, fractured scenes: the text at
last seems unable to carry its own weight, as if the world is falling in on
itself.

Or take Caroline Horton's recent Islands, premiered at the Bush theatre in
London. The play is about tax havens, and was running the week that the HSBC tax
avoidance scandal broke. But instead of presenting a well-made,
explanatory-condemnatory drama, she created a messy, chaotic and sometimes
unpleasant work that instead expresses the moral ugliness of tax evasion - the
real, exploitative horror that lies behind the elegant business suits and clean,
light offices that mask the practices in question. It was rude, scatological,
tasteless, funny, and in many ways, not at all enjoyable. But its echoes have
stayed with me.

Perhaps the most politically radical thing theatre is doing, this spring of
2015, is not airing the issues of the day, but insisting its audience sit in a
place, with our fellow humans, watching other humans doing and speaking, being
moved to pity and fear. And insisting its audience do so, furthermore, without
recourse to email, Twitter or Facebook, without, for a span of time,
contributing to the algorithmic churn of Google. That, maybe, is the small, true
act of resistance that all theatregoers undertake.",16.16197328,1,1,1

he has occasionally been confused with David Mellor, the Major-era cabinet

in scandal.

Wealthy from his family's luxury homeware and beauty business, Mr Meller, who
left school with four O levels, had thrown himself into the education world in
recent years. In 2013 he was appointed by Michael Gove as a non-executive
director of the Department for Education. In 2014 he became chairman of the
government's apprenticeship ambassador network, for which the Tory Nick Boles
praised him at the dispatch box - before having to clarify, after jeers, ""not
that David Mellor"".

In 2016 Mr Meller became chairman of the government's apprenticeship delivery
board and earlier this month Nadhim Zahawi, the minister who attended the
controversial dinner, became his co-chairman. Last year he joined the board of
the Mayor's Fund for London, a social mobility scheme, and in this month's New
Year's honours list he was made a CBE for services to education. His involvement
in the Presidents Club, revealed yesterday, means that of the stream of
accolades, only the CBE remains.

Mr Meller, 59, is joint chairman of the organisation's charitable trust,
alongside Bruce Ritchie, a property developer. His political ties began with an
interest in education. He is chairman of the Meller Educational Trust, which
governs two secondary schools on the outskirts of London and is involved with
more schools.

After a career in journalism and the City, the ambitious MP narrowly lost out to
Nick Clegg for the Lib Dem leadership

FULL TEXT

The Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, was born Christopher Murray
Paul-Huhne, the son of a businessman and an actor who was once, reputedly, the
voice of the speaking clock.

He enjoyed a privileged education at the prestigious fee-paying Westminster
School before studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. At Magdalen College, Oxford, he
ditched the double-barrel to become plain Chris Huhne, edited the student
magazine Isis, served on the executive of the Oxford University Labour Club and
gained a first-class degree in PPE.

He set out on a career in journalism, working for the Liverpool Daily Post and
Echo, and working as an economics editor and columnist on the Guardian and
Independent newspaper titles.

Before embarking on a political career Huhne worked in the City, becoming
managing director of Fitch IBCA and then vice-chairman of Fitch Ratings. After
unsuccessfully contesting Reading East and the Oxford West and Abingdon seats
for the Liberal Democrats in two general elections, he was elected as a member
of the European parliament for south-east England in 1999.

He won the Eastleigh seat in May 2005 with a majority of just 568.

Overtly ambitious, within months of becoming an MP he was challenging for the
leadership of his party following the resignation of Charles Kennedy but lost
out to Sir Menzies Campbell. Two years later, he challenged Nick Clegg for the
top job, losing by a slender margin.

Huhne retained his Eastleigh seat in May 2010 with an increased majority over
the Conservatives of 3,864.",6.670137985,0,0,0

 Novellist AL Kennedy, who has written for Comment is free on Downton values
and the ""austerity state"". She writes:

Those wealthy enough to own land are endlessly rewarded, everyone else can fight
it out. And the English just put up with it. New Downton means the most
vulnerable do most to support the debt bubble on which our economy balances.
Those least able to manage have to manage most: the culled council house stock,
the impossibility of escaping high rents, the bedroom tax, the lack of
one-bedroom houses, in short the endless hounding of people who have done
nothing wrong other than to be poor, old, young, weak, female, not white. If you
like, having no one left to prey upon, the empire has come home to eat itself
and, although I hate to contradict David Cameron, being consumed by an alien
power only makes for a wonderful party if you like being a canap.It seems the
next tranche of ""welfare reforms"" - I suppose hitting something with a hammer
does reform it - will compel all claimants to open bank accounts. It's more than
possible that negative interest rates will then punish them for doing so. Beyond
April, the Downton state will cleanse whole boroughs of the financially onerous
and potentially unsightly poor. (Sort of like asking your servants to use the
back stairs, so you don't have to see them. Or tunnels. Tunnels would be good.)
And anyone who needs a disability benefit to survive will be forced deeper into
repeating cycles of cynical reassessments, humiliation, cancellations, appeals,
stress, reinstated benefits, reassessments... Outside the Paralympics, most
disabilities below penthouse level are not lauded.

 Campaigner Sue Marsh, who has blogged on her experience as a hospital patient
over recent weeks. Compared with 2007, she writes, hospitals ""are horribly,
dangerously and miserably short staffed"". In a post directed at David Cameron
and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, she writes:

Oh, you can go on about ""cutting management waste"" or ""streamlining"" but as you
knew very well, we already had one of the most efficient health services in the
world. You can hide behind your statistics, you can obfuscate about ""no real
term cuts"" but you know as well as I do, the NHS needs 6% extra per year to
survive. And it's not getting it. AND you're insisting they restructure from top
to bottom at the same time.So this is my experience, as a patient : Some of the
deaths will be down to cruelty. Bad practice leads to bullying and cruelty. A
ward or indeed a hospital, out of control, that has lost sight of the patients
it is there to serve will kill people. Just as they did in Mid Staffs. But let's
not kid ourselves any longer - it's happening up and down the country. Until we
face this and accept we are only ""angels"" under the right circumstances, people
will die. Lots of them. Our Mums and Dads and Sons and Daughters and Babies and
Wives and Husbands will die. Say it again. They'll die. Needlessly and in
lonely, desperate misery.But more will die from cuts. And the trauma will be
double. Because the staff who are left WILL care and will simply be unable to do
the jobs of four or five. They will go home, every night, knowing they left a
patient in pain. Knowing they left them hungry. Knowing they left them lying in
their own filth or dehydrated or without vital feeds or medicines. Perhaps their
blood slowly seeping away onto the floor, left for a night shift who fight all
night, 2 staff short to save a life and never get a chance to staunch the flow.
Dying quietly or dying dramatically, we'll all be dying.

 The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, who told the Telegraph this weekend
that defence spending should be the chancellor's priority, and cuts should
instead come from the welfare budget. He said:

There is a body of opinion within Cabinet that we have to look at the welfare
budget again. The welfare budget is the bit of public spending that has risen
the furthest and the fastest and if we are going to get control of public
spending on a sustainable basis, we are going to have to do more to tackle the
growth in the welfare budget.

And he added:

I am a Conservative. The kind of Conservatism I was brought up on says that the
first priority of the government is defending the country and maintaining law
and order. Those are the two top priorities for me.

In response, Sarah Ismail, editor of the Same Difference blog, writes:

Sir, please defend the country. Please maintain law and order. But please
remember that many of the very people who live every day in the very country you
work so hard to defend are using the welfare budget to survive. If you cut the
welfare budget any further, Sir, your soldiers will return to a country which
will have a much smaller population than the country they left behind. Then your
soldiers will have less people to defend, Sir, and then you won't be able to
complain about cuts to your defense department.

Afternoon summary

         Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader, has said the party needs ""an
          open and honest debate on the right way forward"" after announcing the
          timetable for a four-month leadership contest. She said:


Our challenge now is to use this time to listen and learn, to elect a new Leader
and Deputy Leader who will rebuild the Labour Party in order to take the fight
to this Tory Government and to stand up for Britain.

This contest will be run under the new rules we agreed last year: a broad and
open contest with one person, one vote. We want as many people as possible to
take part. More than 30,000 new members have joined the party in the last few
days and I hope many more members and supporters will take this opportunity to
have their voice heard.

Unions will have until the middle of August to get their members to agree to
become affiliated Labour members if they want to take part. The new leader will
be announced on Saturday 12 September. This timetable is something of a
compromise; calls for a swift contest have been dismissed, but the election will
not take as long as those wanting it dragged out to the party conference, or
beyond, hoped. (See 4.17pm.)


         A cache of secret memos sent by Prince Charles to senior Whitehall
          ministers has finally been published, following a 10-year freedom of
          information battle between the Guardian and the government.


         Ministers are considering amending Freedom of Information legislation
          to strengthen the ability of the government to veto the publication of
          documents, Downing Street has revealed.


         Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said Labour lost the
          election, not because it was too leftwing, but largely because it had
          a muddled message on austerity and lacked a coherent narrative linking
          together individually popular policies.


         Jim Murphy is facing growing calls to step down as Scottish Labour
          leader from critics inside the party after overseeing its worst
          electoral defeat in its history. As Severin Carrell reports, a group
          of centre-left MSPs, trade unions including Unite and former MPs who
          lost their seats in last week's rout is openly challenging Murphy's
          leadership before a Scottish Labour executive meeting on Saturday.
          Scotland's largest union Unison gave Murphy breathing space after it
          stepped back from calling for his resignation but it said on Tuesday
          that it could support calls for him to stand down if ""a wider movement
          proposed change"".


         Nigel Farage has failed to resolve a standoff with Ukip's only MP,
          Douglas Carswell, over whether the party should accept around 3m in
          public funding.


         Rupert Murdoch has taken to Twitter to claim the UK general election
          ""explodes the myth of social media power"".


         Ten thousand people have joined the Liberal Democrats since last
          Thursday's general election, giving the party a welcome fillip after
          losing 48 of their 56 MPs in the vote.


That's all from us for today.

For Labour, Stephen Bush's analysis of in the New Statesman of how hard it would
be for the party now to win a majority will be deeply depressing.

The whole article is well worth reading, but here's an extract.

To secure a majority of one, Labour now needs a swing of 8.75 percent across the
United Kingdom, analysis passed to the New Statesman has revealed.

The analysis - which brings together the vote shares, turnout figures and
majorities for the seats that would be easiest for Labour to take, highlights
the challenge to Labour if it is to return to office in 2020. The document is
not a target seat list but would form the beginnings of one.

In, Cleethorpes, the seat that on a uniform swing would deliver a Labour
majority of one, Labour trails by 7893 votes. In the equivalent seat in 2010,
Norwich North, Labour was just 3901 votes behind, and would have required a mere
4.6 per cent national swing to deliver the seat into the party's hands. An
equivalent swing now would see Labour win just 39 seats...

In Labour's lowest-hanging targets in 2010, the party now faces an uphill task
in 2015. North Warwickshire, the party's number one target, now has a
Conservative majority of 2973, up from 54. Just one of Labour's top ten targets,
Thurrock, has a Tory majority of under a thousand. Even in Thurrock, the
majority has increased from 92 to 536.

To win a majority of ten, Labour would have to win Harlow, Shipley, Chingford &
Woodford Green, Filton & Bradley Stoke, Basingstoke, Bexleyheath & Crayford,
Kensington, Rugby, Leicestershire North West, Forest of Dean and Gillingham &
Rainham. Of those ten, four - Chingford, Kensington, Filton & Bradley Stoke and
Basingstoke - have never been won by Labour at any point in its history. All are
Conservative-held.

Nicola Sturgeon is likely to have her first face to face meeting with David
Cameron later this week where she plans to insist the prime minister honours the
hefty mandate the Scottish National party won last Thursday.

The SNP leader told MSPs she will ""argue for the protection of the vulnerable
against deeper welfare cuts, we will seek to defend our human rights
protections, to halt further privatisation of the NHS and to safeguard the UK's
place in Europe.""

But her statement, which was short on any detail about specific policies, also
added to the confusion over what the Scottish government wants to do with the
Smith commission proposals to allow Scotland to control income tax, and when.

On Monday, the SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said he expected to see
the Tory government enact the Smith powers first and then meanwhile build on
them to agree further powers later this parliament.

Some 36 hours later, Sturgeon appeared to contradict Robertson. She implied she
wants the Smith powers reviewed first with a new process in Scotland, telling
MSPs Cameron ""must now agree with us a process that looks again at the Smith
commission proposals, with a view to extending devolution even further. That
must be a process that is made in Scotland - and one that involves wider
Scottish society.""

Claiming that last week's SNP election victory was of ""truly historic
proportions"", she said the SNP won the largest number of votes for one party in
Scottish history, while the proportion of Tory votes cast was their lowest since
1865.

So, it seems to me that the Conservatives now have a clear choice. They can
ignore the voice of the Scottish people and carry on regardless, as if nothing
has happened, and let people draw their own conclusions about the ability of
Westminster to respond to Scottish opinion.

Or, alternatively, they can choose to demonstrate that Westminster does listen
and that it is capable of serving Scotland better.

Police looking into allegation of fraud in Thanet South

Police are looking into an allegation of electoral fraud in Thanet South, the
seat which Ukip's Nigel Farage failed to win at the general election, the Press
Association reports.

Farage lost out to the Conservatives' Craig Mackinlay who racked up 18,838 votes
to Mr Farage's 16,026.

A Kent Police spokesman said: ""Kent Police has received a report of electoral
fraud. Inquiries are ongoing.""

Claims of suspicious behaviour surfaced following a lengthy delay in declaring
the seat's results at Margate's Winter Gardens.

Then the Twitter hashtag #thanetrigged gained momentum when Ukip claimed victory

Farron says Tory anti-extremism plans 'as Orwellian as New Labour's ID card
system'

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem MP, told the World at One that the government's plans
for disruption orders (se e 9.09am) were ""as Orwellian as New Labour's ID card
scheme"".

The anti-extremism orders, first of all they are very wooly - what on earth do
they mean? Who is an extremist? There are probably tens of thousands of people
listening to this programme who will wonder whether or not they are an extremist
for their political views, because of their religious faith or expression of
it...

If you make people into martyrs by persecuting them for expression of views and
opinions, then you create a much worse situation. These are clearly not
proposals brought in by David Cameron in order to solve that problem, they are a
continuation of last week's general election narrative which is about trying to
maintain support for one or other party on the basis of fear of the other...

If you continue to play politics on the basis of division - fear of people who
are different to you - then you will make this problem far worse...

This is as authoritarian and as Orwellian as New Labour's ID card system which
we got rid of five years ago.

Farron also refused to say whether or not he was running for the Lib Dem

David Cameron is not the only politician who has defended Prince Charles's right

From time to time, stories surface in the UK press about how Prince Charles

write and has views on all sorts of subjects - and it's not terrible at all.
Indeed, most of his opinions are pretty sensible, and ministers can either
accept or reject them as they wish.

Here's a Guardian article from Joshua Rozenberg explaining how the supreme court
decided it was entitled to override a ministerial veto and order the release of
Prince Charles's ""black spider"" memos. And here's an extract.

At issue was section 53 of the 2000 act, which allows a minister to certify that
he has formed the opinion, ""on reasonable grounds"", that a government department
is entitled to refuse a request for disclosure. The question for the supreme
court was whether the attorney general's certificate could override the decision
in [Guardian journalist Rob Evans'] favour from the upper tribunal, a court of
equal status to the high court.

[Lord] Neuberger, for the majority [on the supreme court], got round the
attorney's veto by saying that the common law imposes limits on the definition
of ""reasonable grounds"" so as not to undermine the principle that the decisions
of the courts are binding. EU law, which also applied, was even more clear-cut,
he added.

[Lord] Wilson, by contrast, said his colleagues should have resisted the
temptation to uphold the decision of the upper tribunal against the attorney's
veto, even though the government had never appealed against the tribunal's
decision.

No 10 lobby briefing - Summary     10 Downing Street Photograph: Leon
Neal/AFP/Getty Images

Here are the key points from the Number 10 lobby briefing.


         Ministers are considering amending Freedom of Information legislation
          to strengthen the ability of the government to veto the publication of
          documents, in the light of the supreme court's ""black spider"" ruling
          saying some of Prince Charles's letters to Whitehall departments much
          be published. The letters will be published at 4pm, following the
          supreme court ruling. Under the original Freedom of Information Act,
          ministers supposedly had the ability to veto the publication of
          material under the Act in extreme circumstances, but the supreme court
          decision in the Charles' letters cased exposed a loophole in this. The
          prime minister's spokesman said the ruling had ""generated some
          uncertainty"" about how extensive the power of veto was and that, in
          the light of this, the government would look at the law with a view to
          boosting the veto power. He said the government would consider the
          issue ""carefully"", and taking into account views across the House of
          Commons. The government believed there was ""a strong case"" for
          ministers having the right to veto the publication of material, he
          said. In 2011 the FoI legislation was amended to provide an ""absolute
          exemption"" on all requests relating to the Queen and Prince Charles,
          although that did not stop the release of the ""black spider"" letters
          because they predate that. The spokesman implied that the proposed new
          veto powers would go further, covering a wider range of material, not
          just royal letters.


UPDATE AT 1.56PM: I've amended the penultimate sentence above because it was
Labour that passed the bill to exempt the Queen and Prince Charles's letters
from the FoI Act, not the coalition, although the new rules came into force in
2011. See 1.56pm.


         The spokesman said Cameron still believed that the supreme court's
          decision to order the publication of the letters was ""deeply
          disappointing"", as he said in March.


         Downing Street has signalled that the proposed anti-extremist
          disruption orders announced today (see 9.09am) will not be used
          against people like trade unionists advocating law-breaking, or those
          speaking out against gay marriage. The spokesman said the orders were
          intended to be used instead against people like Islamist extremist and
          neo-Nazis. And he pointed out that the government already has a
          definition of the kind of extremism these orders are intended to
          target. It is:


Vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy,
the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of
different faiths and beliefs. We also include in our definition of extremism
calls for the death of members of our armed forces, whether in this country or
overseas.


         The spokesman said that the government could consider tightening
          asylum rules in relation to extremists.This was a proposal that
          Theresa May set out in her speech on counter-extremism in March. The
          spokesman said the government was also interested in May's plan to
          tighten the rules allowing universities and colleges to sponsor
          immigrants applying for student visas. Asked if May was also keen on
          imposing benefit sanctions on people who do not learn English, as she
          implied in her March speech, the spokesman said: ""I don't think she
          has changed her view on that.""



         The spokesman said Cameron was still opposed to the planned 10% pay
          rise for MPs. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has to
          review this proposal, and the spokesman said Cameron would ""urge it to
          take the opportunity it now has to come to a different view"".


    Wolfgang Schauble. Photograph: Valda Kalnina/EPA

         The spokesman said that comments from the German finance minister
          yesterday, reported in today's Financial Times splash, had been
          over-interpreted.He said a ""gentle note of caution"" was appropriate.
          This is how the FT wrote up the story, under the headline: ""Germany
          lands early blow against Britain's hopes for EU treaty change.


David Cameron's hopes for a far-reaching overhaul of Britain's relationship with
the EU were dealt an early setback on Tuesday when Germany said the UK's
partners would not be rushed into changing the bloc's treaties to meet its
reform demands.

In a sign of a broader distrust of London's motives, Wolfgang Schuble,
Germany's finance minister, also lashed out at George Osborne's ""silly"" and
""unnecessary"" record of intervening over the eurozone crisis. Many in Brussels
believe London intentionally sought to undermine monetary union, Mr Schuble
noted.


         Cameron has chaired the first meeting of the new government's national
          security council. And Downing Street has named those attending. They
          are: PM, chancellor, foreign secretary, home secretary, defence
          secretary, business secretary, energy secretary, international
          development secretary, Cabinet Office minister (Oliver Letwin), chief
          of the defence staff, heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, head of JIC, head of
          Foreign Office and national security adviser. This is much the same as
          under the coalition, although now the business secretary is a
          permanent attendee. Other ministers may attend when particular issues
          are being discussed.

Labour will announce new leader on 12 September, reports say

The Press Association is reporting that Labour's national executive committee
will choose a shorter leadership campaign, meaning the winner would be in place
by the party conference at the end of September.

Balloting is expected to open in mid-August, leaving three months for
campaigning by the candidates, with the results announced on 12 September.

Here's the PA report:

The timetable for electing Ed Miliband's successor is expected to see the Labour
Party's new leader announced in mid-September.

The party's ruling national executive committee meets later to make a decision,
but sources have told the Press Association that the new leader is set to be
announced on September 12.

Balloting is expected to open in mid-August, leaving three months for
campaigning by the candidates.

Announcing the new leader on September 12, a day before the TUC Congress opens,
would mean he or she would address the Labour Party conference at the end of
September already in place.

Another option would be an earlier campaign, with the winner announced in
mid-August, or a later date at the end of September. It is understood that the
executive will plump for the September 12 date.

A Labour spokesman said the NEC would have ""full discretion"" in deciding the
timetable for the election, taking into account the opinions of members,
constituency Labour parties, the shadow cabinet and Parliamentary Labour Party.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and shadow health minister Liz Kendall
have both confirmed they will stand in the election, with others tipped to join
the race including shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, shadow home
secretary Yvette Cooper and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham.

Meanwhile, Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has indicated she is open to putting her
name forward for the position of deputy leader of the party - setting up a
potential tussle with Tom Watson, the party's former deputy chairman.

You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here.

And here are three articles in other papers I found interesting.


         The Times says David Cameron considered making Boris Johnson culture
          secretary.


David Cameron floated the option of making Boris Johnson culture secretary in
discussions before his cabinet reshuffle as he tried to lock the London mayor
into a government role.

Mr Cameron completed his appointments yesterday, handing junior ministerial
posts to former rebels from both wings of the party. The prime minister failed,

97544044,"The most significant revolution of the 21st century so far is not political. It
is the information technology revolution. Its transformative effects are
everywhere. In many places, rapid technological change stands in stark contrast
to the lack of political change. Take the United States. Its political system
has hardly changed at all in the past 25 years. Even the moments of apparent
transformation - such as the election of Obama in 2008 - have only reinforced
how entrenched the established order is: once the excitement died away, Obama
was left facing the same constrained political choices. American politics is
stuck in a rut. But the lives of American citizens have been revolutionised over
the same period. The birth of the web and the development of cheap and efficient
devices through which to access it have completely altered the way people
connect with each other. Networks of people with shared interests, tastes,
concerns, fetishes, prejudices and fears have sprung up in limitless varieties.
The information technology revolution has changed the way human beings befriend
each other, how they meet, date, communicate, medicate, investigate, negotiate
and decide who they want to be and what they want to do. Many aspects of our
online world would be unrecognisable to someone who was transplanted here from
any point in the 20th century. But the infighting and gridlock in Washington
would be all too familiar.

This isn't just an American story. China hasn't changed much politically since 4
June 1989, when the massacre in Tiananmen Square snuffed out a would-be
revolution and secured the current regime's hold on power. But China itself has
been totally altered since then. Economic growth is a large part of the
difference. But so is the revolution in technology. A country of more than a
billion people, nearly half of whom still live in the countryside, has been
transformed by the mobile phone. There are currently over a billion phones in
use in China. Ten years ago, fewer than one in 10 Chinese had access to one;
today there is nearly one per person. Individuals whose horizons were until very
recently constrained by physical geography - to live and die within a radius of
a few miles from your birthplace was not unusual for Chinese peasants even into
this century - now have access to the wider world. For the present, though maybe
not for much longer, the spread of new technology has helped to stifle the call
for greater political change. Who needs a political revolution when you've got a
technological one?

Technology has the power to make politics seem obsolete. The speed of change
leaves government looking slow, cumbersome, unwieldy and often irrelevant. It
can also make political thinking look tame by comparison with the big ideas
coming out of the tech industry. This doesn't just apply to far-out ideas about
what will soon be technologically possible: intelligent robots, computer
implants in the human brain, virtual reality that is indistinguishable from
""real"" reality (all things that Ray Kurzweil, co-founder of the Google-sponsored
Singularity University, thinks are coming by 2030). In this post-ideological age
some of the most exotic political visions are the ones that emerge from
discussions about tech. You'll find more radical libertarians and outright
communists among computer scientists than among political scientists. Advances
in computing have thrown up fresh ways to think about what it means to own
something, what it means to share something and what it means to have a private
life at all. These are among the basic questions of modern politics. However,
the new answers rarely get expressed in political terms (with the exception of
occasional debates about civil rights for robots). More often they are
expressions of frustration with politics and sometimes of outright contempt for
it. Technology isn't seen as a way of doing politics better. It's seen as a way
of bypassing politics altogether.

In some circumstances, technology can and should bypass politics. The advent of
widespread mobile phone ownership has allowed some of the world's poorest
citizens to wriggle free from the trap of failed government. In countries that
lack basic infrastructure - an accessible transport network, a reliable legal
system, a usable banking sector - phones enable people to create their own
networks of ownership and exchange. In Africa, a grassroots, phone-based banking
system has sprung up that for the first time permits money transfers without the
physical exchange of cash. This makes it possible for the inhabitants of
desperately poor and isolated rural areas to do business outside of their local
communities. Technology caused this to happen; government didn't. For many
Africans, phones are an escape route from the constrained existence that bad
politics has for so long mired them in.

But it would be a mistake to overstate what phones can do. They won't rescue
anyone from civil war. Africans can use their phones to tell the wider world of
the horrors that are still taking place in some parts of the continent - in
South Sudan, in Eritrea, in the Niger Delta, in the Central African Republic, in
Somalia. Unfortunately the world does not often listen, and nor do the soldiers
who are doing the killing. Phones have not changed the basic equation of
political security: the people with the guns need a compelling reason not to use
them. Technology by itself doesn't give them that reason. Equally, technology by
itself won't provide the basic infrastructure whose lack it has provided a way
around. If there are no functioning roads to get you to market, a phone is a
godsend when you have something to sell. But in the long run, you still need the
roads. In the end, only politics can rescue you from bad politics.

In the developed world, impatience with politics takes another form. We don't
look to technology to rescue us from failed states. We look to it to rescue us
from overbearing ones. Politics in the west can appear bloated and stale. By
contrast, the tech world looks dynamic, flexible and exciting. It invents stuff
all the time. It is relentless in its search for what works, unencumbered by
sterile political mindsets. When did a government last create anything as
beneficial for the public welfare as Wikipedia? When did a bureaucracy ever
invent anything as life-enhancing as Google?

It can be painful watching democratic politicians attempt to play catch-up with
the new technology. They know they need to try, but often they don't know how. A
few politicians have worked out how to use Twitter effectively, but most only
get the public's attention when they discover new ways to make fools of
themselves. The track record of many government bureaucracies in making best use
of the new technology is lamentable. More taxpayers' money in Britain has been
wasted on mismanaged IT projects in recent years than on anything else,
including mismanaged wars (and the cost of these is driven inexorably higher by
the wasteful expenditure of the military on hi-tech systems that turn out to be
less efficient than the ones they replaced). There have been countless local
experiments around the world in how to use the internet to promote more
accountable and efficient government: online town hall meetings, interactive
consultation exercises, micro-referendums. The trouble comes in knowing how to
filter the results, learn from them and then scale them up. Government is not
much good at any of this: it fails to pick up on what works in time to take
advantage of it.

These failures help breed contempt for politicians not only among citizens but
from the tech industry, which often assumes that government is simply an
obstacle to be overcome, an analogue annoyance in a digital world. But there are
some things the tech industry doesn't understand very well. Its blind spots
include the story of its own origins. There would be no tech industry on the
scale we know it today without government. This is not simply because every
industry needs stable and reliable political institutions to uphold the property
rights on which its dynamism depends. (Tech giants are hardly less litigious
than previous industrialists, and some of them, in their voracious appetite to
buy up and protect patents, are as litigious as anyone in history.) It is
because government investment is what made the information technology revolution
possible in the first place. The historical evidence shows that really big
technological change requires vast amounts of waste. Someone has to be willing
to throw huge sums of money around, knowing that most of it will be money down
the drain. The foundations of the information technology revolution were laid
during the cold war. It has its roots in the massive US government research and
development programmes of the 1950s and 1960s. During this period most of the
money spent on scientific research in the US came out of the military budget.
That spending was fuelled by cold war paranoia - we've got to out-invent those
crazy, ruthless Russians! - and it was enormously wasteful. But it was what made
the difference. The internet began life as a military project; so too did text
messaging. Of course, government didn't know what to do with these things it had
created. (The US military assumed that texting would have only very limited,
exclusively military, uses.) The whiz-kids of the tech industry had to step in
and turn scientific innovation into marketable products: from Milnet and Arpanet
to Google and Twitter. Private companies do that sort of thing much better than
government does. But private companies can only do it because of the heavy
lifting that's already been done by government, spending the public's money like
there's no tomorrow.

The same story can be told about fracking, another transformative technology
that is enriching plenty of private individuals who can claim to be supplying a
public good (cheaper fuel). Whether or not it is a public good remains
debatable: the environmental costs have yet to be reckoned. What is much harder
to claim is that the people making the money are the ones responsible for the
technology itself. The crucial innovations were a consequence of large-scale
government spending on new means of energy extraction during the 1970s. The
driving force behind that spending was the decade's oil crisis, starting with
the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, which triggered a quadrupling of oil prices and a
worldwide recession. Politicians were terrified of the possible consequences of
oil scarcity: civil unrest, military weakness, social breakdown. Frightened
politicians promote technological revolutions to forestall political ones.
Further down the line, private investors reap the rewards.

Unfortunately, fracking doesn't herald the advent of a green technological
revolution. It is simply a more efficient way of extracting hard-to-get-at
fossil fuels. A big shift to green technology would take something extra: a
fresh set of acute political threats to get the politicians spending our money
to the extent needed to spark a fresh round of innovation. For now, the
politicians are more scared of other things, including the risk of running out
of the public's money. Anyone who thinks that technological innovation driven by
market forces alone will solve a problem on the scale of climate change is
deluding themself. Market players aren't willing to take big enough risks to
effect the genuinely transformative changes. Only governments do that.

At the moment, the one government that is investing on a significant scale in
green technology is China. This spending is driven by fears of popular unrest in
response to the very high current levels of pollution. In many parts of China
ordinary citizens have been living with filthy water and toxic air for a long
time, and there are signs that they are not prepared to put up with it for much
longer. The Chinese government is worried about what some future environmental
disaster might do to its hold on power. But Chinese government spending will not
be enough to make the difference on its own, and for now western governments do
not face the same kind of fears. So they are holding off. Things will probably
have to get worse before they have a chance to get better. As yet, climate
change hasn't got politically scary enough: there needs to be a greater threat
of violence. That's the truly scary thought.

&#10086;

States can do plenty of things that business organisations can't. States fight
wars; Google doesn't, and not just because the company motto is ""Don't be evil"".
Google lacks the organisational capacity and the coercive authority for war. It
couldn't fight one even if it wanted to. A state - the US - put a man on the
moon, another massively costly enterprise that had all sorts of unexpected
technological spin-offs. Google might like to do something as ambitious, but it
wouldn't dare be so reckless with its cash. (The Apollo programme cost well over
$100bn in today's money; the space shuttle programme cost twice as much, or more
than half the current net worth of Google.) States - thanks to their tax-raising
powers - are able to pool resources to a degree that not even the biggest
businesses could match.

But businesses can do plenty of things that states can't. Google has just come
up with a self-driving car that actually works. It has married its mapping
technology to its super-smart computers to produce a machine that performs a
complex task far more safely than any human being could manage. Google's
self-driving cars don't crash (so far). It is hard to imagine a government
programme resulting in a self-driving car that didn't crash. Governments tend to
screw up complex, open-ended tasks like that. (The mission to put a man on the
moon was complex, but it wasn't open-ended: it had a straightforward,
hard-to-miss target in the moon itself.) Governments don't build good cars. The
hopelessly inefficient and unreliable bangers turned out by the communist states
of eastern Europe - their puttering Ladas, their tin-box Trabants - are enduring
testimony to that.

Most resources work best when they aren't pooled. Competition encourages
diversification as well as innovation. There are limits to what markets can do,
however. Champions of the free market have a tendency to extrapolate from its
creative power an unjustified faith in its ability to solve any problem. Yes,
private enterprise has given us the self-driving car, which may one day have the
power to change the way we live. (Sit in the back, read a book, sleep, work out,
make out and suddenly your daily commute becomes the best part of your day.) But
that car still needs roads to drive on and rules to govern what happens there.
What about the people who don't want a self-driving car, or can't afford one, or
simply enjoy being behind the wheel? Who is going to manage the transition from
a driven to a driverless world? Google won't do it. Government will have to.

If the self-driving car is going to become the industry norm, it will take time
and it will be messy. The transport network will have to adapt, the insurance
industry will have to adapt and the legal system will have to adapt (not least
to decide what to do with all those people who still insist on their right to
have crashes). The market may be able to take care of some of these things over
time, but it won't be able to take care of all of them, certainly not all at the
same time. Change on that scale is too fractious: as Hobbes said, people have an
inbuilt tendency to collide. Government needs Google to build a car that really
works. Google needs government if its car is ever really going to work.

New technology has made it much easier for government to oversee what people and
institutions are up to in order to check that they are not posing an
unacceptable risk. Government can now spy on us in all sorts of exciting new
ways: read our emails, listen to our phone calls, track our text messages,
access our bank accounts. Government being government, it often does this
inefficiently and cack-handedly, which only makes it more frightening. The
revelation that the US government has been routinely conducting electronic
surveillance on its own citizens has caused deep disquiet. Among the people who
have been most disturbed are members of the tech industry. Their unease is
twofold: first, techies don't like being spied on; second, they don't like not
being able to prevent it. After all, it's their technology that's being abused.
This puts the giants of the tech industry in a bind. They have to admit their
complicity - we could have stopped it, but we didn't - or they have to admit
their powerlessness - we couldn't have stopped it even if we had wanted to.
Either way, it makes them look like pawns of the state.

No one likes to see politicians using technology as an instrument of control,
least of all the people who invented the technology. But we have to remember the
alternative to politicians controlling the tech industry: it's the tech industry
controlling the politicians. Government using its monopoly power to manipulate
Google is bad. But Google using its monopoly power to manipulate government
would be worse. Who would you rather controlled your government: a techie or a
politician? I'm afraid we're stuck with politics.

One question that has yet to be answered in China is whether the country's
technocrats have the political skills to cope with all the small failures that
are bound to accompany its shift to a consumer economy and world power. For now,
China's technocrats remain in control (the Chinese political elite since 1989
has been dominated by engineers). They have even managed to corral the internet
as an instrument of managerial politics. The Chinese state employs tens of
thousands of online snoopers, whose job is to oversee the way China's citizens
use the new technology and make sure it doesn't get out of hand. This is not
simply an exercise in censorship and suppression (though there is plenty of
that). It is also a way for the state to find out what irks its people, so as to
head off those grievances before they become unmanageable. In the absence of
elections, this is a valuable service. At the dawn of the information technology
revolution in the 1990s there was a widespread hope that it spelt doom for
authoritarians because they would not be able to control it. That is not what
has happened. The internet has not democratised the Chinese state. Instead the
Chinese state has used it to bypass democracy. Of course, it's not easy to
control something as complex and multifarious as the web: it is a cumbersome and
time-consuming business; it requires lots of money and lots of coercive power.
That's why the only people who can do it are politicians.

Can they keep doing it? The information technology revolution is a long way from
being over; in many respects it is only just beginning. At some point China's
politicians will fail in their attempts to manage it: something will get away
from them. Already China's citizens are proving adept at finding ways through
and around the firewalls created by the Chinese state. Technology moves faster
than politics. What happens when the state's determination to hold on to power
collides with the unruliness of the modern information technology age remains to
be seen. It is the great unknown of 21st-century politics.

&#10086;

In the west, technocracy doesn't mean rule by engineers. It means rule by
economists and financiers. But since 2008, it's been increasingly tough for
financiers to assert their legitimacy as political decision-makers. Might the
wizards of the tech industry have a better chance? There are signs that the
disdain of Silicon Valley for the squalid world of politics is starting to
dissipate. Tech giants who once thought they were above the miserable business
of law-making have begun to take an interest in how laws get made. They've
noticed that laws are going to get made anyway, so they might as well spend some
of their vast resources trying to get the laws they want.

However, there is little sign that the people who built the new technology want
to actually do politics themselves, rather than paying someone else to do it for
them. They'll lobby, they'll fund, they'll campaign. Some of them will dabble
with old-fashioned tools of political influence: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos last
year bought the venerable but impoverished Washington Post. But, for now, few
have shown any desire to stand for office or offer their personal services to
the government as agents of the state.

This isn't just a story about tech. Many people retain an interest in politics -
we all would like laws made to suit us - but fewer and fewer people seem
interested in being politicians. It's simply not a very attractive job. In a
world of myriad possibilities, especially for those who have the technical
abilities that bring lavish rewards in the private sector, politics looks like a
real grind. True, successful politicians get to exercise real power now and
then, which must be a thrill. But most politicians are not successful: they
labour away, scrabbling for votes, striving for influence, only to find that
someone has beaten them to it.

The result is that contemporary politics demands an appetite for that gruelling
way of life. I don't have it. Do you? The class of people keen to be involved in
politics is shrinking. This is good news if you do happen to have an appetite
for it. The competition is not what it was, so that a desire to get into
politics is often all it takes to be given that chance. In Britain, the current
crop of leading politicians is drawn from a remarkably narrow set of political
careerists, most of whom have been doing politics since they were at university.
Many of them were at university together.

The present British prime minister, foreign secretary, chancellor of the
exchequer, education secretary, leader of the opposition, shadow chancellor and
shadow home secretary were all part of the same generation of Oxford politics
students. I didn't go to Oxford, but I did go to the same school as David
Cameron - Eton - at the same time he did. When we were there, he was pointed out
to me as someone who wanted to be prime minister. We were 16. Eton is an
absurdly privileged school full of well-connected and ambitious boys, but few
had an interest in politics: most wanted to be bankers or film stars. I only
heard of one other who wanted to be prime minister. His name was Boris Johnson.
Watching these two rise effortlessly to the top of British politics makes it
hard to believe that the greasy pole is as greasy as it used to be.

&#10086;

However, this is not simply a Tory phenomenon. The leadership of the Labour
party is also made up of individuals who are connected to each other by ties of
family and education. Labour politics has been dominated in recent years by the
rivalry between two brothers - David and Ed Miliband - who were brought up
surrounded by politics by their Marxist academic father, Ralph Miliband. The
Marxism didn't stick, but the connection with the world of politics did (both
boys were mingling with the high-ups in the Labour party from their teenage
years). In the future, Labour politics may be dominated by another family: the
husband-and-wife team of Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, currently Ed Miliband's
nearest rivals (now that his brother has gone off to New York in a sulk). Nor is
this simply a British phenomenon. Family ties play an increasingly prominent
role in American politics. The next presidential election could be between the
two clans who continue to dominate American political life: Hillary Clinton v
Jeb Bush, the wife of one president v the son and brother of two more. People
are already speculating about some future contest between Chelsea Clinton,
daughter of Hillary, and George P Bush, son of Jeb. At the state level, many
families have a strong hold on the top jobs, from the Cuomos in New York (the
current governor is the son of a former governor) to the Browns in California
(ditto). The children of politicians are as likely to become politicians as they
have ever been.

&#10086;

The narrowing of the political class through family ties is a function of the
professionalisation of politics and the increasingly high barriers to entry.
Politics has become a specialised business, and the best way to get good at it
is to do a lot of it. It helps to start early. It also helps to have connections
with anyone who can give you a head start. At the same time, politics has become
a widely despised profession. (A recent survey suggested that most American
parents would rather their children did almost anything else.) So it helps to
have parents or siblings who can encourage you to give it a go, notwithstanding
what the rest of the world thinks. Politics is hardly unique in this respect.
Lots of children end up doing what their parents did, simply for reasons of
familiarity. My father is an academic sociologist, and here I am writing this
piece. I don't really know why it turned out like that. I don't think it's
especially sinister, though it's not very imaginative on my part. I suspect that
for many politicians the situation is not much different.

Does it matter that the political class is shrinking? In one sense, no. It is a
sign of broad satisfaction with the political system that most people don't want
to have anything to do with politics if they can help it. However, there are
real dangers to the narrowing of the political class. It opens up a gap between
politicians and the rest of us, which can breed contempt both ways. If we think
that professional politics is only for the peculiar people who have a interest
in politics, we will start to look down on them as weirdos. Meanwhile, the
politicians will start to look down on us as fools, because we don't understand
the business they are in. The disdain many voters feel for professional
politicians is matched by the disdain many professional politicians feel for the
voters. Each thinks the other lot don't get it. As the gap grows, it becomes
easier for politicians to gravitate towards their fellow elites, who at least
have a respect for insider knowledge. The political network intermeshes with
networks of financial, technological and military expertise, which lock the
public out.

Ordinary citizens haven't given up on politics entirely. In some respects there
has been a proliferation of political activity beyond the traditional outlets.
As the membership of mainstream political parties has fallen away and voter
turnout has declined across the western world, irregular political campaigning
has expanded. Concerned individuals often coalesce around issues that reflect
their own particular interests. The new information technology has been an
enormous help in this regard, enabling ad hoc pressure groups to form and
allowing like-minded individuals to find each other and share their concerns.
But this too creates an imbalance between the political class and the rest.
Professional politics is becoming more concentrated at the same time that
citizen politics is becoming more fragmented. The new technology brings people
together, but it also separates them out by hiving them off into online silos of
political concern. The connections that are made through the new technology can
be speedy, but for that reason they may also be superficial. Malcolm Gladwell
wrote in 2010 that ""the revolution will not be tweeted"". He is probably right.
Political change requires more lasting and durable connections. There is a
danger that a proliferation of unconventional campaigns leaves the political
class to sew up the lasting connections among themselves.

Above all there is the danger that Benjamin Constant warned against 200 years
ago: we need to keep paying attention to politics however much we would prefer
to be doing something else. Vigilance is the price we pay for our freedom. If we
leave routine politics in the hands of a narrow group of specialists, we won't
know how to take it back from them when we need it. The multiple scandals of the
last few years - the banking scandal, the MPs' expenses scandal, the
phone-hacking scandal, the GCHQ/NSA scandal - have tended to generate a
widespread sense of powerlessness alongside the occasional spasms of fury. The
political elite have been exploiting our inattention to shore up their own
position. We would like to hold them to account for their temerity, but we lack
the tools to do it: their superior knowledge of how politics works leaves us
feeling impotent. People who think they can pick up politics when they need it
often find that when they really need it they don't know where to find it. The
professionals run rings round them. The only way to learn how to do politics is
to keep on doing it, in good times as well as bad. We need more politics and we
need more politicians.

187976312,"George Osborne was accused of mounting a ""stealth raid"" on the NHS, schools and
the police, as he forced public sector employers to pay an extra 2 billion in
pension contributions.

The surprise move effectively pushes the combined cuts imposed on Whitehall
departments to 5.5 billion a year by 2020 - and this time hospitals and schools
get no protection.

The move, will mean that hospital managers, head teachers and police forces will
have to find hundreds of millions of pounds from their budgets to fund
contribution increases. Due to a technical change in the way pensions are valued
the Treasury documents reveal that the Chancellor gains an extra 2 billion by
the end of the parliament.

This is on top of the 3.5 billion he will gain from efficiency savings imposed
on most departments (bar health, schools and defence) and the 640 million to be
raised by lowering the cash spent on overseas aid so that it remains in line
with 0.7 per cent of GDP, which has been downgraded. A further 1.3 billion will
be raised from cuts in disability payments allowing Mr Osborne to meet his
welfare cap this year. Public sector employers criticised the raid. ""Raising
employer contributions for public sector pensions is a stealth cut,"" Rob
Whiteman, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, said.

Whitehall officials said that a technical change in the ""discount rate"" for
pension contributions was necessary due to lower than expected growth.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, which represents senior civil
servants, attacked the Chancellor. ""By announcing a change to the discount rate
on public sector pensions they are effectively removing a further 2 billion
from public services and transferring it to the Treasury to give the illusion of
a surplus: a political con-trick that can only damage public services.""

The changes will affect all schemes funded by the Treasury, covering the NHS,
teachers, the armed forces and the police.",6.803938417,0,0,0
187975329,"House price growth in the UK's biggest cities will return to double digits this
year as activity in markets that have been slow to recover from the financial
crisis begin to heat up.

The average cost of a home in Britain's 20 biggest cities leapt by 9.4 per cent
in the year to November to an average of 229,300, up from 8.4 per cent in
October and 6.6 per cent in May, said Hometrack, the residential analyst, which
believes the figures will be back in double digits by the end of the year.

This has been driven by large cities outside southern England, whose housing
markets have been slow to recover but are now experiencing a revival.

The average cost of a home in Glasgow, for example, was up by 8.3 per cent at
110,500, while in Manchester it was 7 per cent higher at 141,200, both the
highest rates of annual house price growth since 2007.

In contrast, the most expensive boroughs in London, whose average values have
rocketed since 2009, are recording the weakest growth as tax and currency
changes hit demand.

In Kensington and Chelsea, prices were down by 2.6 per cent, while in City of
Westminster they were up by 1.3 per cent. These areas have both been hit hard by
George Osborne's changes to stamp duty, which mean that buyers of expensive
homes have to pay more, while those at the lower end of the scale generally pay
less. Richard Donnell, the director of research at Hometrack, said: ""Improving
consumer confidence and low mortgage rates are boosting demand in cities where
the recovery in house prices is in its infancy. While southern cities have been
in recovery mode for over six years with price gains of up to 70 per cent, the
large regional cities have seen far more modest price rises over just the last
three years.""

He said that the outlook for the next 12 to 18 months would be a balance between
how much the high-growth cities slow on affordability pressures and how much
more momentum will come from cities where the pick-up in house prices is
beginning.

Separate figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders found that gross mortgage
lending reached 21.8 billion last month, 8 per cent higher than 20.1 billion
in September.

This is the highest monthly figure since 2008. Lending rose 19 per cent year on
