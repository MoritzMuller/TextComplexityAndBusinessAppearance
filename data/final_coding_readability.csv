155611007,"Sadiq Khan asks to meet in the Lahore Kahari, his local curry house, in Tooting.
I haven't eaten all morning - don't want to spoil my appetite. Khan walks in,
shakes my hand tightly, sits down and starts talking 10 to the dozen. It's only
a couple of weeks since the election, and he says he's in the final stage of
grief: acceptance. But it's still painful. ""It's quite upsetting... "" he exhales
loudly. ""Thoroughly depressing. I was inconsolable."" He apologises for the speed
of his delivery. ""Two things you know when you're a Khan: speak fast or you're
not heard, and eat fast or you don't eat."" I make a mental note to get in quick
with the food.

Khan, 44, is one of eight siblings (seven of them boys) born to a bus driver
father and housewife-seamstress mother. He grew up in this part of south London,
and still lives around here, as does his mother (his father died in 2003) and
the rest of his family. He points out of the window to the mosque across the
road - his local. The Henry Prince council estate where he grew up is a bus-ride
away in Wandsworth; the house his parents later bought is a short walk, and he
now lives 10 minutes away with his lawyer wife Saadiya and their two daughters.
As local MPs go, you don't get much more local than Sadiq Khan.

word

It's a fascinating geo-history, but my mouth is watering. ""Do you fancy some
food?"" I say. He looks surprised. ""Well, let's see how we get on."" So we carry
on talking, not so much as a poppadom and glass of water between us. I'm
beginning to understand why we're here. Khan, the consummate politician, never
misses a photo opportunity - this is Sadiq in his manor.

He asks where I'm from. Manchester, I say. He grins. ""Come down here, take our
jobs, take our women, bloody immigrants!"" Khan could have been created by
screenwriter David Simon - say, the successor to Tommy Carcetti as mayor of
Baltimore in The Wire. He is fast-walking and fast-talking, with steel behind
the smile; a wheeler-dealer with an eye permanently on the prize. (And then the
next one.)

As it happens, the MP for Tooting does now hope to be mayor - of London. First,
he must see off fellow Labour hopefuls, then dispatch candidates from rival
parties. Let's just say he's quietly confident; he already has the backing of
Unite, the largest trade union, and the GMB.

Khan was one of Ed Miliband's lieutenants, responsible for the general election
campaign in London. ""We did very well by the way,"" he says. ""We kept all 38
seats and won seven others."" So why did Labour get hammered? ""There was a
concern among those who aren't poor about what we could do for them, I suspect.""
Are the candidates for leadership of the Labour party strong enough? ""Let's wait
and see,"" he says non-committally. Look me in the eye, I say. He does, but still
doesn't answer with any more conviction. ""It's too early to tell. I've got no
horse in the race.""

The one thing he won't do is rubbish Miliband's legacy. Too many of his
colleagues are already doing that, he says, looking back on the Blair years
""with rose-tinted glasses"".

""A word I think you'll hear overused in the leadership contest is 'aspiration'.
It's used in a pejorative way to suggest we didn't understand what it meant. I
understand what it means. It means your dad working all the overtime hours that
London Transport will give you, aspiration means your mum, notwithstanding
having eight children, works as a seamstress at home as well to make ends meet.
Aspiration means, as a 24-year-old trainee solicitor, sleeping on a bunk bed in
your mum and dad's home to save for a deposit. So I get aspiration."" This is
classic Khan - defending Labour while promoting his ability to lead London in
the same breath.

During the election campaign, Khan warned Labour MPs who had already announced
they were standing for mayor not to put personal ambition before the party.
Within a week of Labour losing the election, he stood down as shadow justice
minister and shadow minister for London, and announced his bid for the mayor. By
his own logic, surely Labour need him in the shadow cabinet? ""Yeah, it was a
tough one."" Did his daughters, aged 15 and 13, think he should go for the
leadership or mayor? ""Mayor. Maybe children are smarter than you think, and they
saw I'd have much more fun as mayor of London. I'd be able to do what I want to,
whereas being leader of the opposition is a far tougher proposition."" It's a
surprising answer - not least because he insists he does not want to be a
""red-carpet mayor like Boris"". In the end, he says, it goes back to what London
has done for his family, and what he'd like to see it do for future generations.

He loves to tell the story of the bus driver's son made good; the boy who
learned to box to look after himself on a tough estate (two of his brothers
became amateur champions), who went on to captain the school's cricket team and
had trials for Surrey, who became a human rights lawyer representing victims of
police abuse, and who sacrificed a brilliant legal career to serve his people.
It is an inspirational story. And like all good lawyers, he retains the ability
to tell it his way, always the master of his own narrative.

Khan began his legal career working with eminent human rights lawyer Louise
Christian as a trainee in 1994, when she was in partnership with Mike Fisher.
They made Khan a partner in 1997. Five years later Fisher left and the company
was renamed Christian Khan. But when Khan was selected as Labour candidate for
Tooting in 2004 he quit without notice.

""I walked away from the business. I wasn't paid out because I wanted to be a
full-time politician. It's never been about money for me, so Louise took over
the firm and I became an MP."" It was a brave decision - Khan had no salary for
six months while campaigning. But it is also a selective interpretation of
events.

I later hear that Khan hired lawyers threatening Christian with legal action
unless he was compensated for his share of the company - and that only after
Christian suggested a counter-claim (because she and his clients had been left
in the lurch by him) did he drop the matter. I ring Khan to ask if it is true.
He says he doesn't know about a counter-claim, but yes, he did threaten legal
action. ""I was concerned about my tax liability, but ended up taking that on the
chin. And strictly speaking, I was entitled to half the firm, and my lawyer
advised me to pursue everything I was entitled to. In the end, I decided not to
because I wanted to get on with my political career."" Khan admits that he and
Christian have not talked since he left the firm.

Christian had been his mentor, and hoped he would one day take over the
practice. Does he regret the way things ended? ""Yeaaaah,"" he says, weighing his
words carefully. ""But you've got to move forward. In my next venture, where I'm
mayor of London, I can't be looking backwards to my 10 years as an MP. You've
got to move forward.""

As chair of the human rights pressure group Liberty in the early noughties, Khan
campaigned against imprisonment without trial, then in 2005 as a new MP voted
against Labour's proposal to hold terrorism suspects for 90 days without charge.
""When I first got elected, everyone said, 'Sadiq's a rising star, he's going to
go all the way.' But Blair wanted to pass 90 days, and you've got a choice: do
you hold true to your beliefs and speak out against it? And I did. It was the
first ever defeat Blair had."" Did it make an enemy of Blair? ""Oh my God, yeah!
There were some people who never forgave me. I was threatened."" How? ""That
'you're finished as an MP, you've got no chance now'. Whips said that, other MPs
said that.""

Yet, three years later Khan was the whip responsible for pushing 42-day
detention without charge through the Commons. What would the Khan who chaired
Liberty make of Khan the politician? ""The thing you've got to remember is, it's
a different role you're performing. As the chair of Liberty, your job is to to
put pressure on governments of whatever colour, right?"" Ultimately, he says,
you'll get nowhere as a politician unless you compromise. ""You've got to think:
do you want to be a megaphone politician or do you want to get things done? ""

Khan has always had a reputation in politics - as he did in law - for getting
things done. Do you have to be ruthless to succeed? ""Ruthless? No. Decency can
get to the top in politics.""

There seems an element of ruthlessness in going from challenging detention
without charge to championing it, I say. ""No,"" he protests, ""it's not about you.
It's about who you did it for. So, when I'm a lawyer, I'm doing it for my client
- he or she is the most important person, not me. When I'm a member of
parliament, constituents are the most important people. When I'm chair of
Liberty, our members are the most important people. And when you're mayor of
London, London is the most important thing. So you'll be ruthless for your
clients, ruthless for your constituents, ruthless for London, without
necessarily being ruthless as a person."" You sense that whatever job he does,
Khan will always see himself as a lawyer - the eternal advocate.

David, the photographer, arrives. ""Your job is to make me look really really
good,"" Khan tells him, running his hand through his hair. ""Clooneyesque is the
job spec."" He laughs. ""Yes, Clooneyesque."" Is it true he likes to think of
himself as ""cool and metrosexual""? ""This is interesting, you see. When I see my
children's friends' parents, right, I look at myself and say to my girls, 'Come
on, you've got a cool dad, surely?', but they say, 'no Dad, you're not cool.'
They say my taste in music is not cool."" What does he like? ""Jay-Z, Paul Weller,
Sting."" What else do his girls say about him? ""They say I'm a smart Alec because
I like to have the last word.""

David suggests, as we're in the curry house, it would be nice to take pictures
of him eating. This time, Khan is more keen. He speaks in Urdu to the manager,
Rizwan, and asks him to order for us.

""How spicy do you like it?"" Rizwan asks.

""Not very spicy,"" Khan answers for me. ""He lives in north London! The article
will be as good or bad as the food - so make it good!""

I ask Khan why he would make the best mayor, and suddenly it feels like I'm
interviewing him for the job. ""I went to a good local state school, had an
affordable university education, one of my brothers had an apprenticeship,
council accommodation. Today's Londoners don't have the same opportunities we
had, and it breaks my heart. But being disappointed about it is not enough. I
want to do something about it. And I've got the experience - I ran a successful
business before becoming a politician, lawyer for more than 10 years, big jobs
in government, I understand what makes London tick, I've got ideas whether it's
housing or helping businesses or reducing inequality or the living wage."" He's
talking faster and faster. ""Also, I want to get things done. I'm not doing it
because it's just a reward for long service or because I couldn't hack it in
politics or in law. It's because I've genuinely got something to offer.""

David suggests a picture of Khan tucking into a poppadom. He looks appalled.
""Don't even try that. Listen, it's got to be proper food. Not a poppadom.
There's an urdu word, gora, which means white. So you guys are gora. The joke
would be, 'that's gora food'.""

But back to pitching for mayor. ""First of all, we need a candidate who's going
to win. So, I'm the only candidate who's fought and won a marginal seat. On
every occasion my share of the vote has gone up. I was in charge of the 2014
London elections; not only did we keep all 15 councils we won another five. We
had the best ever European election results in 2014.""

Dish after dish arrives - fish massala, chicken methi, seekh kebab, lamb karahi
- the smell is overpowering, the taste heavenly. But Khan doesn't seem
interested. David asks if he could stop talking for a second. Khan smiles at the
waiters. ""Well, he can make me look Clooneyesque or make me look like Ed eating
a bacon sandwich, so I've got to be nice to him."" And then back to me. ""The
reason we won the most seats in the European election was because we did well in
inner London and outer London, so I get the science and the art of winning
elections. I'm a winner. So if we want a candidate who will win the election in
May, I think that's me.""

Are you not going to eat, I ask. No time, he says - a mayoral candidate's work
is never done. His assistant tells him they had better be on their way. I'm
staring at all the dishes in front of me; Khan wraps a kebab in a serviette and
prepares to head off. I ask him if it's true he does standup comedy. Only at
Labour party functions, he says. ""At my last gig, I met Windsor Davies from It
Ain't Half Hot Mum. He said I was very funny. Arthur Smith says I'd be a very
decent standup comic."" What's his best joke?

""I went to hospital last week to meet the surgeons. I said: 'What's the easiest
form of people to operate on? Surgeon One says: 'The easiest form of people to
operate on are accountants, because you slice them open and all their parts are
numbered.' Second surgeon goes: 'No, actually you're wrong, the easiest people
to operate on are librarians because you cut them open and all their parts are
in alphabetical order.' Third surgeon goes: 'No, you're both wrong. The easiest
people to operate on are politicians.' I said: 'Why?' He goes: 'Well, last week
we had Jeremy Hunt in here and we sliced him open, and he was headless,
heartless and gutless and his head and arse were interchangeable.' Thank you.
We've gotta go.""",1,1,1
187969054,"It's one of the laws of politics that if you have something important to say,
you must leave SW1 to say it. It's about escaping from the Westminster bubble
and surrounding yourself with ""ordinary"" people in the hope that it makes you
look more normal (or, in Ed Miliband's case, semi-normal).

Location, location, location. I can Just hear the brainstorming session over
where Ed should go for his Big Welfare Idea.

""It has to be gritty,"" says one man. ""But not too gritty,"" says another. ""It
can't be West, that's too Westminster,"" says another man (Ed's team is a bit
male).

""I know, let's go East, but to the new shiny bit!"" said another.

So that is how we all ended up going on an awfully big adventure to Newham
Dockside, a giant tin can on the Thames that is so shiny that there are signs in
the lifts that say: ""Inspiring People"". It is, I can report, close to a
Docklands Light Railway stop called Cyprus and, no, they don't take euros there
- yet.

Ed stood in front of a window overlooking the river glittering in the sun, and
shiny City Airport. I couldn't help but notice that, from where I was sitting, a
little white luggage van kept nipping in and out of Ed's armpit. Every once in a
while a plane would head out from the side of Ed's head and, with a roar, lift
itself into the air.

I wish I could say the same for the speech. It was 36 minutes long (not that I'm
counting). Ed said, in the first minute, Labour would have to be ""laser-focused""
on how to spend every pound. What chance of that, when they can't even laser a
speech? Ed began by giving us one of those false choices that politicians
specialise in. (Do you want to boil in a vat of oil or spend the day by the pool
drinking cocktails? Gee, that's a tough one, I'll get back to you.) So here's
was Ed's choice. Did we want to remake the welfare system so it worked better,
was fair and sustainable? (As he said that, a little white van reversed over his
elbow).

Or? ""Take the Conservative way,"" he said ominously. This was, he explained,
ripping away the safety net, dividing the country and generally getting drunk on
Bolly and eating Eton mess.

Hmmm. Ed explained that he had ""planks"". These were not Just any planks. They
were ""One Nation"" planks. One of the planks was housing. He's building more,
possibly with planks. I had a vision of entire estates of One Nation houses,
made up of planks and shiny little signs that said ""Inspiring People"".

I looked around: the One Nation crowd was fighting narcolepsy. I don't think
even Ed was enJoying himself (but who would with all that traffic in your
armpit?). Forget One Nation Labour. This was One Nation Be-Laboured. Ed revved
himself up for the final series of ""inspirational"" sentences which coincided
with a plane taking off from his right ear.

There was a question session for the press and the ordinary people. After two
media questions about Labour tax affairs, Ed searched the room. ""I'm desperately
looking for an ordinary person,"" he said.

Finally he found her. ""What,"" demanded a woman, ""will One Nation Labour do for
suburbia?"" Ed looked, for Just a moment, frightened. Real people can do that to
you. But surely Ed, that is the key. Forget new homes. What about new gnomes?
Surely it's time to give the little people a chance.",1,1,1

187984130,"Schools are listed under local authority areas and ranked on the percentage of
eligible pupils reaching the expected standard in reading, writing and maths in
tests taken in May.

Where scores are equal, the percentage of pupils who achieved a high score is
used as a tie-breaker followed by the average score attained by pupils across
reading, grammar and maths, and then the cohort size. Tables show the top ten
schools in each area.

Schools with five or fewer candidates are excluded to avoid identifying
individual children. Results are from state-funded primary and middle schools.
Independent schools do not have to take the tests and are excluded, as are
special schools, pupil referral units and hospital schools

187976586,"Monday Flying in from my home in California, I land at Heathrow and head into
central London in a Zorb.

I know less creative people prefer taxis and trains, but I always find I see the
world in a completely different way when I roll head over heels down the M4,
dodging traffic in a giant inflatable hamster ball. Back in 2010 I was close to
getting Dave and George to introduce mandatory Zorbing lanes on every motorway
in Britain. Alas, it couldn't be done. And we all know whose fault that was.
Yeah. Europe.

My first stop, obviously, is Downing Street.

""Oi,"" says the policeman on Whitehall. ""Mate. You can't park that here.""

""But it's me,"" I say. ""The Guru. Remember? I used to be here all the time.""

The policeman says that doesn't mean I can come in without a pass.

""But clearly my kaftan has no pockets,"" I point out.

Tuesday What actually is ""the European Union""? Listen. Imagine we made it
smaller.

The size of a walnut. Could we carry ""Europe"" wherever we went? Obviously I
couldn't. Not right now. Because my yoga pants don't have pockets either.

But other people? People less creative? That's the EU debate we should be
having. Not this one. It's positively outmoded. And childish! All these scare
stories. Much as I love Dave and George, that's them all over. It reminds me of
2012, when I had the brilliant idea to sell off all social housing and force the
inhabitants into huts made of mud and wattle.

""It'll be brilliant!"" I remember enthusing. ""It could lead to the forming of a
new agrarian, sustainable society!"" Only George said it might just lead to
disease and death and everybody left being really cold. It was Project Fear all
the way.

Wednesday I'm bouncing through Westminster on my Space Hopper when I spot Nigel
Farage.

""Nigel!"" I shout.

""Sorry,"" he says. ""I don't have any change.""

Then I remind him that it's me, Steve, the Guru, and he says oh yes, the chappie
with the sandals. And I say, ""Clogs, actually"", and he says, ""mmm"".

And then I tell him that I'm desperate to play a bigger role in the Brexit
campaign and I'd like to buy him a pint.

""Bitter,"" he says, when we get into the Red Lion. ""And a Scotch egg.""

""Unfortunately,"" I tell him, ""I no longer carry money. The thought of it
literally makes me cry. In terms of our basic humanity, I find it not just
bizarre but menacing.

Certainly there are practical issues but in the end, it's all about my personal
freedom.""

""So I'm buying my own pint, then?"" says Farage.

""Thanks,"" I say. ""I'll have a smoothie.""

Thursday Today I'm doing Question Time on BBC One. In a wetsuit, for some
reason.

Ed Miliband is here. I always liked him. He had the best ideas.

""Really?"" says Ed, when I tell him this. He sounds quite surprised.

Totally, I say. That massive stone with all the promises on it? Genius.

""Right,"" says Ed, looking grim.

""Although it would have been better in Play-Doh,"" I muse, as he walks away.

""Or soy cheese?"" Friday Finally, I meet up with Dave. He's pretty cross about
the column I wrote in the Daily Mail, in which I said that the EU made Britain
literally ungovernable.

""Come on,"" he says. ""You know that's not true.""

Of course it's true, I say. All those ideas I had! Dayglo policemen! Relocating
parliament to a treehouse! Giving every child a chicken! Banning all cutlery
except the spork! The Michael Gove Fitness Video! Jobseeker animal onesies!
Turning the Church of England into a chain of coffee shops! Velcro buses!
Privatising the Queen!

The prime minister has his eyes closed.

""And every time,"" I continue, ""you'd tell me that the only thing stopping us was
the EU!"" ""No?"" says Cameron, opening them again.

""Yes!"" I say. ""Hilarious,"" he says.

*according to Hugo Rifkind",1,1,1
155609651,"1. Can we be honest here, it's time for a written constitution, isn't it?

2. After Cameron's comments to the Daily Mail and LBC questioning the
""credibility"" of a Labour government, how long will he squat at No 10, like
Howard Hughes with rolled-up sleeves, ordering in takeaways and watching The
Iron Lady on repeat, refusing to resign?

3. Although, he is entitled to for a while - so are all of these questions of
legitimacy even relevant?

4. Can't people just read the Cabinet Manual (PDF), which is pretty clear on the
rules?

5. Ed, speaking in 2010 makes it clear too, doesn't he?

6. Can we not all just agree, then, that a government is formed when a majority
in the Commons passes a vote of confidence ?

7. The SNP probably wouldn't dare to vote down a Labour Queen's Speech and
therefore isn't Ed Miliband right to call their bluff ?

8. And what is the SNP's true position on calling a second referendum ?

9. Do we believe SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie when he threaten s to hold
Labour's budget to ransom in return for a promise on a second referendum?

10. Or Leanne Wood when she says Plaid Cymru could also vote against a Labour
budget?

11. Leanne Wood's great, isn't she?

12. Is any party capable of just telling the truth regarding them not having a
hope in hell of winning a majority?

Related: What happens if no one wins the election?

13. Or capable of answering a straight question at all?

14. Will a minority government just fall apart like a biscuit in tea, triggering
a second election by Christmas, as Clegg suggests?

15. Why are all the supposedly unionist parties content to treat the Scottish
people like shit? Pretty much even before the No vote was fully in.

16. What are the parties' positions on ""English votes for English laws""
(otherwise known as the West Lothian question, otherwise known as Evel?)

17. Did all the people now realising what a goddamn mess our parliamentary
system is vote yes to AV in 2011?

18. And how would this election be looking if AV had been implemented? (It's
actually not good news for the Lib Dems or Labour ...)

19. Should Sinn Fin stop pissing about and start sending their elected MPs to
actually sit at Westminster?

20. What, exactly, does Ed Miliband have in his pocket?

21. Is he hiding some kind of claw in there?

22. Can the Tories and Question Time audience members stop making comparisons to
Greece, when the British economy was never anything like it ?

23. Can we all agree not to vote for people who use the terms ""Grexit"" and
""Brexit""?

24. Does anyone remember, as Paul Krugman points out, that John Maynard Keynes
wrote this: ""The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the
Treasury.""

25. Where are the 12bn of spending cuts proposed by the Tories coming from
(just 2-3bn has been accounted for )?

26. No but, actually. Where are they coming from?

27. I'm deadly serious: does anybody know any figures on this?

28. Whose idea was the #EdStone and on a scale of 1-10 how mortified is that
person?

29. Why was The Sun's headline on this not ""ED'S STONE(D)""?

30. Might Labour have used said stone to build some houses?

31. Speaking of houses, have the Greens worked out how they will build 500,000
social rented houses in five years? Because their costings still look a little
loose, and last time that question was asked it wasn't answered very well...

32. Is it awkward that one of Labour's policies is to allow the Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) to ""independently audit every spending and tax
measure in the manifestos of the main political parties"", when the Institute for
Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pretty much slagged them all off ?

33. And do people actually even trust the OBR ?

Literally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for
Labour

Paul Johnson, IFS

34. Clegg is probably going to stay in Sheffield Hallam thanks to Tory tactical
voting. He's actually been pretty good this campaign, hasn't he?

35. What are we going to do about the duopolies that fund our parties? (Tories
backed by big donors to the tune of 1.36m, as revealed by new Electoral
Commission figures.)

36. Is it fair that Lycamobile UK, a telecoms firm which has not paid
corporation tax in Britain since 2007 should be allowed to donate 124,450 to
the Tories?

37. If you are suddenly run over by an ice cream van on 7th May and whizzed to
hospital, can you still vote? ( YES, if run over before 5pm).

38. Whose great idea was it to rename fracking as ""onshore unconventional oil
and gas""?

39. Which party is the best on climate change ?

40. Who will be the one to tell Nigel Farage that his beloved Australia is, you
know, founded on immigration? I'm talking right back to the Pleistocene
Aboriginal migrants, mate.

41. How disgusting did those sardines and lemon sound that David Cameron
""whipped up"" in his video for SunNation?

42. Does Russell Brand regret encouraging people not to vote, and then holding
his interview with Miliband and U-turning to tell people to vote Labourafter the
voter registration deadline had passed ?

43. Will this have any effect on youth voter turnout, especially in the 18-24
age group? (At least now he is doing his bit).

44. Or is a drop in voter registration thanks to Individual Electoral
Registration (IER) reforms ?

45. That was a canny bit of legislation wasn't it?

46. It's not really fair that 16-year-olds can go to war for this country, pay
tax in it, but not vote, is it?

47. Did the Greens have to pay royalties to John Lennon's estate for this
passage in their manifesto?

48. Has Natalie Bennett said ""the common good"" so many times that the syllables
turn to mush in her brain?

49. Would Labour agree that they formatted their manifesto oddly, so we have
unfortunate looking pages, such as page 8, which looks like this?

50. Isn't it quaint how the Tories started to add the word ""major"" to their
""world's fastest growing economy"" line, when people pointed that, say, China and
India had grown faster ?

51. Wait, and isn't it true that growth just plunged in the last quarter to 0.3%
?

52. What are the differences on Labour and Tories' tax pledges on national
insurance, VAT and income tax? And are they workable?

53. Cameron suggests his promises on tax should be statute. As if bobbies will
come a-knocking on No 10 otherwise. Kind of hypocritical for Osborne to have
said this then, isn't it?

54. Wasn't exactly wise for Miliband to make his c utting the deficit
year-on-year pledge either, was it?

55. Is Liz Truss OK? Or is she still concerned about cheese ?

56. Why does William Hague's voice sound like he is holding in a sneeze and
straining at the same time?

57. Would John Humphrys's specialist Mastermind subject be bias in political
interviews ?

58. Shall we all take a moment to remember David Cameron's Freudian slip ?

59. And Miliband's literal one ?

60. Hard-working families, hard-working families, hard-working families...WHY DO
ALL PARTIES HATE SINGLE PEOPLE? WHAT DO THEY OFFER US?

61. Is the idiom "" putting food on the table "" redundant in the era of TV
dinners?

62. Where is this year's Gillian Duffy or a Joe the Plumber ? Are we going to
have to rely on Gareth from Hampstead Heath or the ""hi Dave, alright mate"" guy
from the Question Time debate?

63. The Lib Dems have already published five red lines. Is their manifesto just
a child's scribble in red Crayola?

64. Has anybody seen the Respect party these days? (Apart from George Galloway
trolling on Twitter.)

65. What's all this about the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), potential Tory
kingmakers, being homophobic ?

66. Didn't their health minister, Jim Wells, resign just last week after saying:
"" You don't bring a child up in a homosexual relationship. That a child is far
more likely to be abused and neglected ""?

67. Meanwhile, who even are the Social Democrat and Labour Party (SDLP)?

68. But why is nobody paying attention to the Cannabis is Safer than Alcohol
party (Cista)?

69. Will Labour's pledge to reduce tuition fees from 9,000 to 6,000 actually
help wealthier students, rather than the less well-off?

70. And will Clegg ever be allowed to shake off his broken promise on tuition
fees?

71. He can probably console himself with some council seats though in local
elections, which I guess is something?

72. Isn't the Tory idea to introduce right-to-buy social housing just a gimmick
which is largely unworkable ?

73. Like, honestly, is it not just a truly awful policy ?

74. How fantastic is it that three of the party leaders - Natalie Bennett of the
Greens, Nicola Sturgeon of SNP and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru - are inspiring
women, and that this photo exists?

75. Can we all agree that Nicola Sturgeon's sarcastic line about Nigel Farage
having "" obviously come here to win friends and influence people "" during the
first TV debate was the best of the campaign?

76. And if Farage does not win South Thanet, will he just slink off back into
his cave, nursing a pint, occasionally venturing out to stop passersby in the
street in the hope that he can convince them that he isn't really posh, not in
the true sense of the word?

Sturgeon's line about Nigel Farage having ""come here to win friends and
influence people"" was the best of the campaign

77. Is the fact that 1.1 million people used Trussell Trust food banks in the
past year an indictment of the previous government?

78. Or, as the Spectator's Fraser Nelson argues, (and Isabel Hardman too ) are
food banks ""a sign of the big society in action"" and something Cameron and co
can be proud of?

79. Do you really want George Osborne or Boris Johnson, as a future prime
minister ? Larks aside now, guys. Because this might happen - and before 2020
too - if Cameron stands down and a second election happens before Christmas. Or,
if a no-confidence vote is passed, possibly within the next 14 days ...

80. Do you want to possibly re-elect an education secretary to cabinet who talks
about exams being ""resitted"" ?

81. Shouldn't it concern us all that our prime minister is a man who cannot say
the word ""tampon"" out loud ?

82. In a country in which mental health issues account for almost a quarter of
the burden on our NHS but receives just 13% of the funding, how, exactly, is the
Liberal Democrats injection of what sounds a very generous 3.5bn going to come
close to what is needed?

83. And with just 6% of the mental health budget spent on children, despite
three-quarters of mental health problems presenting before the age of 18, what
else are the parties pledging towards making mental health care better in this
country?

84. Will Labour be able to stick to its promise to introduce 8,000 new doctors
and 20,000 new nurses ? Will we never have to suffer again?

85. Labour pledges to raise the minimum wage to 8 per hour and the Greens to
10. But does Cameron know how much the current living wage is?

86. Have we decided yet on whether zero-hours contracts are an abomination, or a
means for small businesses to thrive ?

87. But we all know that pulling out of the EU would be anathema to business,
right?

88. And we're 100% clear on the fact that many of the business leaders who
signed the letter to the Telegraph in support of the Conservatives didn't
actually sign the letter in support of the Conservatives ?

89.                     IS TRIDENT A GOOD THING Y/N?

90. And which party is for which number of subs and what level of at-sea
deterrent ?

91. Can we have less of the partners of party leaders featuring in the next
campaign?

92.                     Who looks best in a hard hat, because that is going to
be a deciding factor in our votes, yes?

93. Ditto how a leader eats a hot dog, bacon sandwich or other working class
foodstuff?

94. Has this woman been the true star of the election campaign?

95. And am I the only person currently working on a screenplay shipping Nicola
Sturgeon and Ed Miliband?

96. Shall we just get rid of incessant polling - doesn't it just annoy the
public? -or would that leave Lord Ashcroft at rather a loose end?

97. And are the polls proving right, as stagnant as they have been, or are we in
for a shock?

98. Don't all the party leaders look tired?

99. Aren't we all just, so,so tired?

100. It's only just begun, hasn't it?",1,1,1
187964502,"Ed Balls discards his suit jacket and buttons a white chef's jacket over a
barrel-like chest. ""If I had a proper job, a proper job, not the rubbish I do,
I'd love to do this.""

;What, I ask, run a hotel kitchen? ""It's such a brilliant thing to do!"" he
cries.

;And - you know what?

- I believe him. He may be the Shadow Chancellor, a Tory hate figure and a
Labour bruiser, but the man is, quite simply, cooking crazy. And today, as they
say on MasterChef, he is cooking rhubarb, an entire meal of it.

;We are in Wakefield, which is in his constituency, but which also occupies a
pivotal position in what is apparently known as the Rhubarb Triangle. We've
already spent 30 minutes in a giant tin shed with 30,000 forced rhubarb plants,
lit only by candles, which gives the whole thing a rather ethereal, religious
feel, though a bit camp, too, the air tinged with a rhubarby scent best
described as the embodiment of the colour pink.

;It is one of the weirdest places on Earth and Ed is absolutely loving it. The
thing that most people don't know about Ed Balls is that he can be tons of fun,
possessing as he does the relentless bouncy-castle enthusiasm of a puppy with a
rather big brain. Here, Ed is crouched amid the pink stems topped by stunted
furled yellow-green flags of leaf. A TV light turns his face green, making him
look spooky, like a poltergeist. ""He's used to this,"" says one guide. ""In the
House of Commons, he is surrounded by rhubarb all the time.""

;I think we can safely say that this is a pre-Budget interview the likes of
which you have never seen. Maybe it is the prospect of cooking rhubarb but, on
our two-hour train journey from London, Ed talks about food for at least one
third of the time. He tells me how to cook his Christmas dinner (signature dish:
36-hour gravy) and talks me through, course by course, the famous lasagne ""power
networking"" evening hosted by Ed and his wife, Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home
Secretary.

;Indeed, he goes on about food so much that I have to butt in. I'm worried that
I'm not going to have time to ask about crying, I say.

;Ed laughs. ""We could be talking about the welfare state, nuclear power...""

;His aide, Alex, notes drily: ""This is supposed to be the big pre-Budget
interview.""

;Ed claps his hands together. ""OK. Crying. What do you want to know about
crying?"" Economics will have to wait. We have tear ducts to delve into. Well, I
say, you seem to do a lot of it. You've already admitted that you cry while
watching Antiques Roadshow and One Man and His Dog. ""I don't cry that much,"" he
insists. Well, I say, some middle-aged men hardly ever cry and you seem to do it
quite often. He ignores that. ""The first time I can remember crying, I must have
been 5 or 6. I'd gone to see the Disney version of Robin Hood and there is a
point where the rabbits have saved up all year to give the little rabbit a gold
coin for his birthday and then the Sheriff of Nottingham comes in and says [Ed
does a rough, deeper voice], 'I've come to collect the taxes.' And he takes the
gold coin!""

Oh my God, I say, you were Labour even then.

;""Well, the rabbits had saved all year. Robin Hood comes in to try to save the
day and gives him the bow and arrow. And that made me cry more because, although
the little rabbit was happy with his bow and arrow, it was still the case that
the other rabbits had saved all year and then their opportunity to deliver for
the little rabbit had been ruined.""

;I note that this vignette reveals a lot about him.

;""It does,"" he agrees. ""In a nutshell.""

But he's already moving on - a conversation with Ed is like surfing the Big One
in Maui, but forever - to The Sound of Music. He and Yvette and their three kids
(Ellie, 12, Joe, 10, Madelyn, 7) love this film. He takes me through the plot to
where the father is travelling back to his house to introduce the countess to
the children. ""He walks in and he hears this music, which is the first time
there has been music in the house since his wife died. The children are singing
The Sound of Music and he can't believe it and then he joins in the singing.""

;Ed stops suddenly. ""It is an epiphany! I have never ever watched that film and
not cried at that moment.""

;I tell him that my analysis of his crying is that he's a sucker for family ties
and loyalties, whether these are to objects, animals or humans. ""The thing that
is always upsetting is when you see that betrayed,"" he nods. ""I would find
watching Sophie's Choice almost impossible. Just too much to bear.""

;What does Yvette, who seems cooler in every possible way, make of all this
blubbing. ""It would be fair to say that Yvette [he chuckles] is not overly
tolerant of these moments. She has a sort of 'Good grief' attitude."" Then, all
of a sudden, he cries: ""Little House on the Prairie!"" He sucks in his breath and
I wonder if he is going to cry just thinking about Laura Ingalls Wilder's
classic tale of growing up in the prairies of the old American Midwest. ""Oh. My.
God!""

Oh my God indeed. Or, perhaps, good grief. I think you may be beginning to see
what I mean by surfing the Big One. Many politicians have very little
hinterland, but Ed Balls has a small country's worth. He is 45 and has become a
little philosophical with it. ""Because I've been around a long time and done
some things that I think were very important, which I am very proud of, I don't
spend my days thinking, 'One day I'll get the chance to do something
important...'""

Can this really be true? Who knows, certainly not Ed, I suspect, who is using
his time in Opposition (""hideous"") as a time to explore diversions. There's
music (he plays the violin, the drums and is learning the piano). He helps kids
who, like him, suffer with stammering. His, as in The King's Speech, is an
interior stammer where the fear is that you are going to block. Thus he never
starts a sentence with an ""h"" and talks in ""5 Live"" speak.

;""I'm no good at delivering perfect sentences. Sometimes I get Tories attacking
me, saying, 'Why do you always start a sentence with ""Look""?' You think, 'Sod
off, because it's the only way I can start the bloomin' sentence.'"" We move on
to reading. He whips out A Man of Parts, David Lodge's novel on H.G. Wells,
which looks as if it's been dropped in the bath. ""What a creep,"" says Ed. ""I
never knew he was such a shagger."" Indeed, there may be no topic that Ed cannot
talk on: the man is irrepressible, non-stop, exhausting, questing, obsessive -
and, don't forget, Shadow Chancellor.

;I wonder if part of this crying, music, cooking thing is all about trying to
show his softer side. His life, on paper, seems rather one-dimensional. He grew
up in Norwich and then Nottingham, the son of a zoology professor, one of three
children. He got a first in PPE at Keble College, Oxford, and did postgrad
economics at Harvard. After working at the Financial Times, he spent years, if
not decades, at the side of the famously macho Gordon Brown. Did Gordon, I ask,
really throw phones?

""I think, um, I've never been there, um, when he threw a phone,"" says Ed
carefully.

;But wasn't the whole atmosphere very male? Volcanic?

""One of the very first times I went to visit Gordon, in '92, a senior politician
had written a pamphlet for Tribune which had a different argument than his. It
would be fair to say that Gordon's view of this pamphlet was, at best,
unprintable. I remember thinking at the time: 'Welcome to politics!' It was only
over a long period of time that I realised it didn't have to be that way. I
spent seven years at the Treasury, three years as Secretary of State for
Education, and I think I've barely ever raised my voice in any meeting with any
civil servants or advisers. The times when people were concerned that I was not
happy would be when I was quieter, not noisier.""

;But, I say, people talk of you as a bully. ""In life, and especially in
politics, people caricature in a slightly cartoon-like way.""

;I know, I say, I am a sketchwriter.

;""If I were 5ft 5in, nobody would ever describe me as being a bully,"" he says
(though he is only 5ft 11in). ""I've always been bigger. I am quite tough. You
don't survive 20 years without being a bit tough.""

;But, I say, at the dispatch box, you are an attack dog. The battle between you
and George Osborne at Treasury Questions can be total box office.

;""Being forthright, clear in your views, willing to have an argument, not afraid
to absorb the pressure from other people and push it back, that's not bullying
behaviour. A bully is somebody who, because of their own inadequacies, picks on
people weaker than themselves. The big plus for me in politics in the past 18
years is, I was the person who was willing to stand up to Gordon Brown and tell
him when he was wrong - which actually was a very important piece of public
service!""

I laugh. But I can see that, for Ed, the idea of being seen as a bully rankles,
not least because, as a child with a stammer and an embarrassing surname, he had
his share of it. But, still, the machismo of Gordon's entourage was legendary.
Ed will only admit that, at times, early on, he could be less than delicate in
rejecting some of Tony Blair's ideas.

;""Did I sometimes do that in a youthfully, exuberantly stupid way? Absolutely.
Mea culpa. But you know? People in life grow up. I don't think Yvette would have
put up with me if I were a male macho bully.""

;Mm, Yvette. The other half, the quiet one, at least in terms of interviews, of
the most powerful couple in British politics. They married in 1998 (the only
music at the wedding, Jerusalem and Elvis's Can't Help Falling in Love). Both
had been journalists (she was at The Independent) and economics advisers. Yvette
was elected as a Labour MP in 1997, Ed in 2005. They have neighbouring
constituencies in Yorkshire, a home in Castleford and another in Stoke
Newington, North London. Their three children - whom they are not photographed
with, nor talk about in detail - go to local schools.

;Their daily lives sound, from a logistical point of view, crazed. Take Fridays,
for instance, when they go to their constituencies. One will walk the kids to
school and then get a bus. The other will then try to get on the same bus which
goes to King's Cross, where they both take the 9.35am to Leeds. That afternoon,
a carer (the word ""nanny"" is rejected by Ed) picks up the kids and takes them,
via bus and train, up to Leeds, whereupon the carer goes straight back.

;Interviews with Yvette invariably describe a daily race against time.
""Sometimes,"" she told the New Statesman last year, ""it feels like a triumph to
make it to the end of the week."" Yvette always sounds a bit wistful that their
lives are quite so manic. But Ed seems to thrive on the chaos. He describes a
mad holiday dash to the ferry in Holland - during which, at one point, he
actually flagged down a bus driver on the motorway - with the revved-up glee of
a movie car chase.

;It's all great, he says, until the unexpected occurs: summer riots, sudden
snows, TV interviews, car breakdowns. Actually, even keeping track of the cars
seems impossible.

;Alex, his aide, rolls his eyes as, on the train, Ed tries to remember where his
car is. ""The car conversation,"" says Alex. ""We have this most weeks."" Certainly,
on our day out, Ed is utterly convinced that his car is at Wakefield. But, when
we alight, it isn't there at all. No one bats an eye.

;I feel it is almost inevitable that someone, someday will make a movie about Ed
and Yvette and, when they do, the Costa Coffee scene will be pivotal. This was
around the 2010 election, when they were spending a lot of time on the M1,
albeit going in different directions. If their paths crossed, they would stop at
a motorway service station for a ""Costa Coffee moment"".

;Ah, romance, I cry. It was during this period that they had The Conversation
about which of them would run for Labour leader. Ed cannot remember if this
actually happened on the M1 but, surely, for our movie it will do. So, there
they are, with Ed gulping down his usual double espresso with extra water,
telling Yvette that, if she wants to run, he wouldn't stand. ""I was inevitably
going to be part of the political overhang of the end of Gordon's premiership. I
never thought I could win,"" he explains. ""I said to her that I was happy for her
to decide. If she thought she could win and wanted to win, then that would be OK
by me. On reflection, that wasn't the most important thing to me.""

;I find this hard to believe, for Ed Balls is one of the most competitive people
on the planet, be it in politics, on the football pitch or cooking.

;""Whether or not it was me who was leader wasn't the most important thing to
me.""

;Really?

""Yeah, really,"" he says. ""I spent a lot of time with somebody for whom not being
the leader was the most important thing. It's unbelievably debilitating to your
life, to your relationships, to everything.""

;Ah, Gordon. The man who, when he finally did get the big job, seemed almost
tortured by it.

;""Gordon ended up seeing the difficulties of any situation rather than the
opportunities. He ended up allowing himself to be very hedged in. His problem
was he stood on a platform of change without being really willing to set out
what that meant. Both Ed [Miliband] and I urged him to be much clearer.""

;So what does Ed think of the Gordon era now? Ed mentions his (their) triumphs
as Chancellor, such as Bank of England independence and not joining the euro.
And as PM? ""Nobody is going to look back at any point in history and say that
Gordon Brown was a great Prime Minister, but I think they will look back and say
the leadership Gordon and Alistair [Darling] demonstrated on the world stage in
2007/8 was of monumental significance. That is known around the world, just less
so here in Britain.""

;It's funny, I say, but the person in politics who now reminds me the most of
Gordon Brown is George Osborne, a man who believes he is right, never wavers and
is much fawned over for it.

;""Gordon was never as sneering and narky and personal, but George is being
evasive and Gordon could be a bit evasive."" (""A bit!"" I think.) He remembers, as
an adviser, watching Gordon in a select committee being asked if the tax burden
was rising and refusing to answer. (It was, but Ed says that only reflected a
growing economy.) ""Once Gordon hadn't answered that question once, to answer it
next time would have meant a U-turn. So therefore he went through years of not
answering it. I sat there thinking, I guess once you've made your bed, you lie
in it, but it wasn't a very comfy bed.""

;Ed insists he gets on fine personally with George, but he is scathing about his
priorities as Chancellor, claiming he seems uninterested in jobs and growth. ""I
think his problem is he's a chancellor who doesn't really understand economics
and he's a historian who has not really read his history. If he'd studied his
history, he would know that the huge political mistake of economic policy makers
in Britain over the past 100 years is to believe your own rhetoric and to stick
doggedly to a course in the hope that something will turn up; that, if you say
something is true, it will turn out to be.""

;What, like Gordon saying he'd abolished boom and bust? ""Boom and bust meant the
self-inflicted wounds of big macroeconomic mistakes which had characterised
Britain in the previous 20 years,"" he insists. ""It didn't mean we could abolish
the economic cycle and it didn't mean we could stop economic crises or global
events. Maybe what happened with Tony, then Gordon, after so many years of
stability, maybe they thought it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I am a
politician, but the thing I know is that you can't put political rhetoric before
economic reality, and that is what distinguishes me from George Osborne.""

;Why, he asks, does George insist on putting so much emphasis on the rating
agencies and his austerity plan when, in Ed's view, what is needed is a stimulus
for jobs and growth. ""That is a fundamental difference between us. George still
believes in something he calls 'expansionary fiscal contraction', which is the
more you contract the fiscal policy and cut spending, the more expansionary it
will be. If I am being polite I call it an oxymoron. If I am being impolite, I
call it moronic.""

;He says the coalition wants the big issue of this coming week's Budget to be
fiddling around with tax allowances and not far more important things. ""The way
David Cameron and George Osborne handled the issues around Britain as a place to
invest - around Stephen Hester and Fred Goodwin - will do far more damage to the
long-term investment prospects of our economy than any positive thing they can
do around personal allowances.""

;So was it a mistake to strip Fred the Shred of his knighthood? ""It was a
mistake to announce it at 5pm on a day when David Cameron had had a difficult
moment in the Commons. It made it look like this is the kind of country that is
willing to put that kind of gesture politics before the long-term reputation of
our economy around the world. I think that echoed around the world.""

;Really? But everyone in Britain loved it. ""I think people around the world
thought it was a little bit banana-republic-like.""

;But shouldn't we curtail bankers' bonuses? ""I think the Prime Minister should
not be sitting in Brussels trying to negotiate the pay of one chief executive
[Stephen Hester] over the phone. You know, he's supposed to be the Prime
Minister.""

;When Ed talks about David Cameron, his voice takes on a hard edge, his
arguments become bulldozers. Ed's gestures at PMQs - his ""flatline"" and, his
latest, a shovelling move to show the PM is digging a hole - are part of the
reason Dave has branded Ed the most annoying man in politics. The feeling is
mutual, as becomes obvious when we return (again) to the subject of food.

;I ask Ed about the other Ed. It being the Labour Party, there are always
rumours that the Balls-Cooper household is plotting against Ed M. ""We have been
working together for 20 years and therefore there is no problem about working
together at all,"" he says. ""Ed's not going to agree with everything I want to do
and I'm not going to agree with everything he wants.""

;But have you ever cooked him lasagne? Surely that is the big question.

;""In my life?"" cries Ed. ""Definitely!"" Ed swerves off lasagne (again). He says
that his mum taught him to cook (and not his brother or sister) when he was 10
and, at 12 or 13, he would often cook bits of the dinner. His great passion now
is cooking for large groups. ""I don't write anything down. I'm good at the
logistics,"" says the man who loses his car. ""I'm very good at souffls.""

;But, I say, you are the opposite of a souffl. ""If I talked you through it, you
could cook one dead easy. It's really easy. It's all in the wrist.""

;His speciality is what he calls chi-chi Californian Tex-Mex influenced type
food. He starts giving me way too much detail about Brazilian stews and
coriander so I interrupt and ask if it is true that he and Yvette are holding
secret lasagne dinners. Are they on some kind of charm offensive? ""Oh for God's
sake! For God's sake!"" I am, for once, quiet.

;""No! I am not the Jeffrey Archer of my generation. We do not have shepherd's
pie suppers.""

;He pauses. ""I'll tell you exactly what happened."" Last year he'd cooked a
dinner for his parliamentary team and their partners (""I spent seven years as
the spouse of an MP and I know what it's like to be the lady mayoress"") and
decided to do this for his new team in January. Yvette, seeing it in the diary,
said she'd like to do it, too, but, unless he cooked, it would never happen. ""So
I sort of rolled my eyes and said fine.""

;The combined dinner was on a Wednesday night at 8pm and they were going to be
still voting at 7pm. There were 45 in total, including a vegetarian, a vegan and
a coeliac. On the Monday night, Ed made four lots of meat sauce and one
substituting aubergine. On Tuesday, he did five sets of the cheese roux. ""I use
Cheddar in my sauce, and I use a bit of parmesan, and I use oregano in my rag.
I don't use chicken livers or anchovies.""

;It was lasagne and salad. And dessert? That was Eton Mess - meringue,
strawberries and other fruits and cream. ""We call it the Cameron Dessert,"" says
Ed. Eat your enemy. Now that's hardcore. And, of course, there is no reason why
you can't mix in a little rhubarb.

'I'VE BARELY EVER RAISED MY VOICE IN ANY MEETING'

'GORDON ENDED UP SEEING THE DIFFICULTIES OF ANY SITUATION RATHER THAN THE
OPPORTUNITIES'

'GEORGE IS A CHANCELLOR WHO DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS'

'I DON'T THINK YVETTE WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH ME IF I WERE A MALE MACHO BULLY'",1,1,1
187977040,"So here I am on a wet Tuesday evening sitting in a church in Richmond awaiting
Zac Goldsmith, who is MP for this area, and who is due to take questions from
the public as part of his campaign to become London mayor. As I wait I leaf
through his campaign bumf, which bears the slogan ""Back Zac"", and if you
wouldn't wish to grab a marker pen to add ""And Crack"" then you are a far better,
stronger, more mature person than I.

His constituency, Richmond Park, in southwest London, is well-heeled and I'm
sitting next to a woman in a fur coat who says she feared she wouldn't make it
because her train from Dorset was late into Waterloo.

You live in Dorset? ""My second home is in Dorset,"" she stresses. ""I live in
Kew.""

Is that fur real? ""Yes.""

Do you have a marker pen? ""No."" Zac takes to the stage and speaks for an hour.
He savages Sadiq Khan, Labour's candidate, who has promised to freeze Tube
fares. ""It is a catastrophically damaging promise, and he knows it."" He is full
of ecstatic praise for Boris Johnson, who has ""put London on the map"", even
though, as far as I'm aware, London's never been off it. He talks about housing
and crime and Heathrow, and making the air so clean and shiny you'll be able to
see your face in it, or as good as. He has the audience eating from the palm of
his hand.

There's a standing ovation. You're going to vote for him, I ask the fur woman
who has a house in Dorset but lives in Kew. ""I love him,"" she says, putting her
hand on her heart.

""Don't you love him?"" I don't know, I reply, honestly. I'm still trying to
figure that one out.

I had first met him earlier in the day, at the Brompton Bicycle factory in
Greenford, west London, for one of those high-vis-jacket photo opportunities you
have to endure when you are up for an election. Not that he finds such visits an
endurance. ""I've been invited to things I'd otherwise have not been invited to.
I've been to festivals. I went to the Festival of Life at the ExCel Centre.
That's African Christians, Nigerians mostly, and I've never felt such
exhilaration in a single room,"" he says, stoically. And he's keen on bikes, of
course. ""The Boris bike scheme works, but it would be cripplingly expensive to
spread it to the outer boroughs. Brompton has schemes that are six times
cheaper, so they're part of the future.""

Zac is tall and elegant and there is a nobility to him, like the captain of a
ship, although whether he'll solemnly have to go down with this one won't be
decided until May 5. He is also known as ""the Beautiful One"" because he's
extremely handsome - quite the best-looking Tory I have interviewed, I would
venture - with one of those delicate, unfeasibly pale Eddie Redmayne
complexions. Perhaps it's an Eton thing, this complexion, not that Zac saw out
his time there. Back in the day, Zac was quite the firebrand, and he was
expelled after cannabis was found in his room. He claimed that it wasn't his.
Come on, Zac, you can tell us the truth now. We may vary in maturity, but we're
all adults. Was it yours? ""No! No! It genuinely wasn't. I'm not denying I broke
every rule in the book at school, but on that one occasion, as it happens, I was
innocent, but it was such a rare moment of innocence, there was no point putting
up any kind of resistance.""

Zac always seemed like his own man, and genuinely decent, and people admired
him. As editor of The Ecologist magazine he was an impassioned advocate of
environmental causes. He first became an MP in 2010, and was returned in 2015
with the largest increased majority of any sitting MP in the country, so he has
to be doing something right. He claimed to have no ambition for high office. He
tried to introduce a recall law such that constituents could get rid of their MP
if they were rubbish. He has voted against the government as much as he has
voted with it. He was the anti-politician's politician, beloved even by the
left, who were happy to overlook his wealth, his privilege, his spectacularly
gilded life, because he said things like, ""Not all politicians have to be
scumbags."" But there is some bafflement as to where he is at now.

The stories keep coming. He was recently forced to resign as patron of a
Richmond disabled charity after voting in favour of disability benefit cuts. He
is about to be investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner amid
accusations he failed to declare correctly more than 120,000 in donations.
Also, his campaign is being overseen by the offices of Lynton Crosby. He is the
""attack dog"" strategist who helped Boris Johnson become mayor and who saw to it
that David Cameron was returned to power, and of whom it is said that he can't
look at a belt without wishing to hit below it.

As it is, and with 20 days until London goes to the polls, this two-horse race -
it's Khan or Goldsmith, basically - has already turned nasty, personal and
bitter. Khan is a Muslim, and it does seem as if Zac has been asking: do we
really want a Muslim mayor of this great city? Zac and I do have a bit of a spat
about this, but not quite yet.

For now, we take a taxi across town to a caf in Ealing. Zac is not fizzing with
energy, like Boris. Zac is not like a boisterous red setter chasing a ball.
(Boris also visited the Brompton factory during his campaign and was ""great fun,
a riot"", one worker told me, wistfully.) Zac is low-key, circumspect. Because
I'm frightened of silence, and he's not naturally chatty, I small-talk in the
most deranged fashion for most of the cab ride. Having noted we both chew
nicotine gum, I ask if he's so addicted he has a quick chew should he get up for
a pee in the middle of the www.night.No, he says. Me neither, I say quickly.

I tell him when I asked my son (aged 23) what he'd most want for London, he said
a sniper at the top and bottom of the escalators at every Tube station so that
anyone who doesn't stand to the right gets a bullet to the head. This would
inevitably take its toll on tourists, I continue, but what can you do? We are
with Katy Eustice, his communications director, who stutters, ""That's a bit
harsh,"" while Zac says sagely, ""These days I often travel as part of a group, so
I'm afraid I'd be one of the victims.""

I stall, as tumbleweed rolls through town.

OK, how about a parallel London, built half a mile up, accessible by ladders?
That'll free up more space for everybody. ""I'll stick that in the manifesto,"" he
says. ""If you win,"" says Katy to Zac, ""it looks like you'll have an adviser."" I
would wish to be the mayoral adviser, so I don't confess what I'd most like to
do with a marker pen.

We make it to the caf. Zac has darling manners. He opens doors, pulls out
chairs. I think I would most sincerely love him if we could only stop here. He
orders at the counter and pays, as well he might. While Khan, I think, may be
the son of a bus driver (if so, why doesn't he mention it every two minutes?),
Zac is the son of the late billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith and is said
to be worth between 200 million and 300 million, which is actually quite hard
to get your head round.

I ask him why he didn't ever go down the Tamara Ecclestone route - live in a
Kensington mansion with a designated climate-controlled room for your Birkin
handbag collection and another for gift-wrapping? ""You haven't been to my
house,"" he smiles (he smiles!), ""so how do you know I don't?"" He then adds, ""If
I see something that is wrong, I just want to do something about it and change
it. It was probably drilled into me as a child, although I don't remember it
being drilled into me as a child."" He can be annoyingly vague. But that could
just be because he is supremely wary of the press.

His family have rarely been out of the newspapers. His father, who was married
three times and had eight children with four women, and who was always suing
Private Eye, once even punched a Daily Express photographer in the face. His
mother, Annabel, is the socialite who gave her name to the famous nightclub, and
whose memoir (Annabel: An Unconventional Life) I happen to have read, and can
heartily recommend. She does sound like a lovely, warm, funny woman, I say.
""She's an amazing woman,"" he says.

""She's just so much fun. Her grandchildren, without exception, all adore her and
confide in her and allow themselves to be guided by her, which is kind of what a
dream grandmother is.""

It goes on. His sister is Jemima, who was married to Imran Khan and has dated
Hugh Grant and Russell Brand. His younger brother, Ben, is an environmental
financier whose wife, Kate Rothschild, of the Rothschild dynasty, ran off with a
rapper.

And we're not done yet. Zac was married to Sheherazade Bentley (daughter of
financier John Bentley and the Colombian actress Viviane Ventura), by whom he
had three children, but left her for Alice Rothschild (Kate's younger sister),
with whom he'd been having an affair. (""Goldsmith's secret visits to heiress,""
cried the Daily Mail.) They married in 2013 and have two children: Dolly, two,
and Max, who is only a few months old.

Your wife, I say, must love being stuck with two young kids while you're out
from dawn to dusk pressing the flesh. ""I wouldn't have done this without the
green light from her,"" he says. ""You couldn't have done it without that, not if
you want things to work out."" Campaigning is short term, he says, ""and not for
ever.

I wouldn't do it if it was, because I wouldn't be able to be a good father. Just
not possible.""

Was your father a good one? ""Yeah, he was ... I have nothing to compare ... He
was not as affectionate as I am as a father. He had lots of different families
and lived all over the world, so he wasn't a constant figure.""

Did you mind? ""It's all I knew."" He grew up in the Richmond Park constituency
and was a headstrong boy, from the sound of it. When I ask what his earliest
memory might be, he says, ""I remember nursery school, which I hated; I don't
know why. It was a lovely school and a sweet, nice lady ran it. I ran away. I
remember running down the street in my apron. I went to the local pub. It felt
like miles but it was only a very short journey, and I remember asking someone
to take me home but not knowing where home was, and the headmistress running
along the pavement to scoop me up and take me back.""

His childhood loves, he says, were Gerald Durrell, David Attenborough and
animals. He has a dog, Murphy, rescued from Spain, whom he adores. ""He's an ugly
dog but he has a lot of charisma,"" he says. Sounds like Boris, I say. He laughs.
A little.

By the way, I say, is it open season on Boris or what? Is he such a threat to
Cameron? ""I think there are some people who are just very angry at the stance he
took on Europe.""

He boarded at a prep school where, ""I was always getting the cane."" For what
exactly? ""You got it for nothing in those days."" An example? ""I got the cane for
storing a kettle with hot chocolate under a very dangerous roof, which I used to
climb out onto every night. Silly things.""

And when did you first realise that your family was different; that not everyone
was as rich as you? ""I can't remember a specific moment. But, listen, you go to
Eton and you know you're privileged. You're at a very expensive school with
access to facilities that are not normal in schools and if you're not aware of
that you are completely insulated from any kind of reality.""

Why didn't you ever knuckle down there? You must have been a bright boy. ""I
don't know. I'd just read my own things and learn my own stuff. I just wasn't
good at being organised by the school."" Were you devastated when you were
expelled? ""I had a pang of feeling I was letting my mum down, but my dad never
attached any significance or weight or importance to formal education, so that
was not a concern.""

After Eton, he travelled and then arrived at The Ecologist, which was owned by
Uncle Teddy, his father's brother. He is not, in other words, the sort of person
who has ever had to do multiple mail-outs of his CV. ""But I've never sought to
hide who I am,"" he says. ""I was dealt a very good hand and I've always tried to
play it well.""

You don't think that as a multimillionaire who has never struggled to find work
or an affordable place to live and has never had someone vomiting into their lap
on the night bus (Ever been on a night bus? ""No, but I do take the 33 from
Barnes, where I live, to Hammersmith""), you might not be the best person to
represent your average Londoner? ""Because I'm an MP,"" he replies, ""a big chunk
of what I do is working with individuals through surgeries. Why do you go to
your MP? You go when things are really s***. You don't go just for a chat. It
can be someone who's received an unfair parking ticket at a hospital while
visiting their mum or it could be someone whose life has been wrecked by witness
protection, and everything in between.

""The truth is that a very large number of the people I see have problems I
haven't had to experience, but there isn't a person in the world who will have
experienced all the problems there are. But you need to care about it,
understand it, help solve it, and that's what I do.""

I'm also wondering why he's a Conservative and didn't join the Green party, the
forerunner of which was co-founded by Uncle Teddy. ""He launched it on a camel in
Bury St Edmunds. It was called the Ecology party back then.""

And you didn't think it would be the better fit? ""Every party should be a green
party. If it's not green, it's not a serious party. You need a green thread
running through all political parties. I do think the Green party has become
less and less green and more and more just a kind of very hard-left political
movement. There are no green aspirations that the Green party has that I don't
share, but I think the best way of realising them is through the Conservative
approach. I really believe that.""

I put it to him that, in 2000, when he was editor of The Ecologist, he said of
William Hague, who was then running the Conservative party, ""I'd have to drug
myself before I voted for him. Get drunk beforehand. And then wash myself
afterwards."" He is not best pleased I've brought this up, and is somewhat
discombobulated. ""OK,"" he says, ""I can't deny I said that. But I remember at the
time thinking it wasn't right. I like him a lot more now than I did. But I have
always liked him. He's one of the good ones. I don't think I would have singled
him out personally.""

You did!

""I can't deny it, but I've always felt he was basically a good person.""

We talk about his campaign, and his letters to Sikh voters - or at least those
with ""Singh"" as a surname - which, to cut a long story short, as it comes with
many layers of nuance, basically said that Zac was in their corner, implying
that Khan, as a Muslim, would not be, thereby preying on the historic animosity
between Sikhs and Muslims. His campaign literature states that Khan, in effect,
would wish to tax Indians' gold and jewellery, which, all else aside, seems like
the worst kind of racial stereotyping.

Isn't it the worst kind of racial stereotyping? At this he gets agitated.
Animated, even. There's a spot of colour to those pale cheeks. ""If I talk to
British Indian communities, two issues always come up,"" he says. ""One is the
concern they are being targeted by burglars, and they are. It's a fact they are
more likely to have jewellery in the home. And the other thing that always comes
up is: what the hell is happening to the Labour party?"" Sticking with the
jewellery, I say, there are many diverse groups in London all with their own
concerns, so why not write to younger voters about how you might help them get
on the housing ladder, or older people who are worried about their travel
passes? Why even bring race into it? ""I have written to all the groups,"" he
insists. ""There is no group I haven't tried to communicate with. Letters have
gone out to all groups and the message is the same. It's about housing, it's
about transport, it's about safety ... The idea there is an anti-Muslim thing is
just so wrong. Faith and religion don't come into it at all. This campaign was
always going to get mucky and I think it's a consequence of the choice the
Labour party have made. They have chosen a candidate who applies a very low
standard to the politics he has always pursued. Khan is just not someone who is
straight with the voters. He'll promise the earth depending on who he is
speaking to, and I'm obliged to point out the inconsistencies.""

Which are? ""He was the last minister to champion Heathrow and now he tells us
he's against Heathrow expansion. He was talking to the Jewish community saying
he was resolutely opposed to sanctions on Israel, but just a few months before
standing for mayor he was actively lobbying the Labour party to impose
sanctions. I could go on and on.""

I see. He is incensed about being investigated by the parliamentary standards
commissioner, which he sees as Khan's doing. He has always been transparent, he
says. ""Every donation has been listed with the electoral commission properly, on
time, and it's a public document, but what we failed to do was register it with
the parliamentary registrar in the right time frame. I spotted this a year ago
and took it straight to the registrar and she was fine with it. She was
satisfied. There was no investigation. What's happened is that someone from
Khan's lot has complained and they are duty bound to look into it. Ironically,
if you look through the register of members' interests, he's done exactly the
same thing. If I'd chosen to file a formal complaint, it would have been him and
not me.""

It's a dirty old business, I say. But aren't you better than this? ""You
wouldn't,"" he says, ""do this for fun. But I know if I persuade enough people,
I'll have four years to make a difference.""

Have you had to develop a thick skin? Yes, he says. ""I do look at Twitter. It's
horrific. It's a place that provides millions of little micro-platforms to an
awful lot of very bad people.""

He prefers Facebook, he says. ""You get nutjobs, obviously, but it's not as
violent.""

And The Guardian is hating on you almost daily.

He says, ""You know what? If The Guardian weren't after me, I'd be amazed. I'd
have to assume I was doing something really wrong. You can't take stuff
personally. You can't. Otherwise you'd go mad. You just ignore it and keep on
going, and I feel that the grassroots stuff I'm doing is working."" It's hard to
discern what he does with his downtime, as he doesn't have any downtime. He
hasn't read a book for a year (the last one was by Robert Harris) and he hasn't
been to the cinema, although he does watch Frozen over and over, for obvious
reasons, ""and I know all the songs"".

As for why he wants to be mayor, when he could be gift-wrapping in Kensington, I
think it may come down to that class business of fundamentally believing you
were born to rule, that it's your right to rule, that it's best that you rule,
and it's your moral duty to save the general public from any mortal threat - to
play Superman, say, to Khan's General Zod. I merely put that out there, and it's
not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, just as he's proved a decent MP, I expect
he'll prove a decent mayor, should he achieve power. It's simply the getting of
that power that is so diminishing all round.

187981995,"Get on the phone to The Sun and tell them, 'The Conservatives have saved Tony
the Tiger.' "" August is well known in Westminster as the silly season - when
political spinners like me pump out any old crap in the hope that journalists
are so desperate for stories they run with it.

GHowever, this was pushing it. It was August 2016 and Fiona Hill, the prime
minister's joint chief of staff, had singlehandedly drawn a red strike through
the government's anti-obesity strategy, by scrapping curbs on the marketing of
sugary foods to children. She was so happy about this fact that she insisted the
communications team called The Sun to brag about it. Despite my protests, she
was firm. And it was clear who was boss. To my eternal shame, I let my deputy
make the call, and guess what? Turns out The Sun wasn't that bothered about Tony
the Tiger after all. We had three days of bad media coverage instead of one.

A month into working at No 10 and it was dawning on all of us what the future
might look like. It was grim. Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, the other chief of
staff, both of whom resigned following this year's general election, ran No 10
in one way: you were either with them or against them, and if you dared question
anything then you were frozen out. Timothy was the smart, talented one - he read
and commented on all his paperwork, and his strategic brain was often brilliant,
but every now and then a very angry man would surface and his aggressive
swearing would be inexcusable. I felt he let power go to his head. Hill would be
volatile and unpredictable. I thought her days revolved around an enemy and how
she was going to do them in. Some days I was the enemy. I still have no idea
why.

I once stopped her going to join a bunch of political journalists at the back of
the plane on the way home from a foreign trip, dressed head to toe in
flannelette pyjamas and two bottles of red wine down. In hindsight, I should
have bloody well let her go.

The ""Tony the Tiger"" story is one of 137 I collected during my time as director
of communications at No 10. I purposely didn't keep a diary because I didn't
want people to think that I took the job for that reason. So, despite being
offered a fortune to write a book, I've resisted. But I was worried that, in
time, I would look back on my year inside the No 10 machine through rose-tinted
glasses, that all these moments would flow into one and I would start to
reminisce fondly instead of remembering how bad it was. Hence my 137 little
reminders.

I can laugh about it now, but at the time I was deeply unhappy. This was a job
that I had dreamt of ever since I was 16 years old; a job that I had finally got
through years of hard work and long hours and yet when I finally arrived, I
wasn't actually allowed to do it.

I used to comment that if I ever made it to No 10, I would change the job title
to director of common sense, because no matter who the prime minister is, they
all make mistakes that show them to be out of touch with what people outside the
Westminster bubble think.

When I finally made it, manager of the asylum would have been a better title. It
was the most dysfunctional place I have ever worked - yet I bust a gut on a
daily basis alongside some outstanding civil servants to help keep the show on
the road. And with a 24-point opinion poll lead on the day the prime minister
called the election, I'd say we did an alright job of it too.

So how did a regular comp-educated, south London girl like me end up as director
of communications to the prime minister? It all started back with William Hague
in 2000, when he was leader of the opposition against a formidable Tony Blair.
We were being hammered and I'd walked out on a promising career in the City to
work in the Conservative party press office, where we would have cream-cracker
eating competitions for a laugh. (Harder than it sounds, by the way.) No wonder
we didn't win an election. I was surrounded by double-barrelled-surnamed girls
who were there because their parents ""had a word with someone high up they
knew"", either for the experience or to get married off to a prospective Tory MP.
On paper, I had nothing in common with these people. They came from stately
homes; my mum grew up on a council estate. Yet I absolutely loved it. Nearly 20
years later, many of us still keep in touch.

In the run-up to the 2001 election, some bright spark thought it would be a good
idea to cram two people to each desk. Being no Kate Moss, I wasn't best pleased.
I need not have worried. On day three, the toilets collapsed under the pressure
of twice as many people as normal using them. I remember Trevor Kavanagh,
political editor of The Sun at the time, commenting on the way into a press
conference that the place not only churned out shit (I think he meant our
eye-catching policies), it also smelt of it.

I remember my job interview with Amanda Platell, now a Daily Mail columnist, who
back then was press secretary to William Hague. It consisted of one question:
""Do you like cats?"" I replied that I did, but I lived on a busy road so I didn't
think it was fair to have one.

Amanda's two-worded reply - ""Move house"" - and my nod were taken as acceptance
that I would move, she would give me the job and I would accept it. I became the
press office manager, a grand title for someone who did everyone's donkey work -
not quite what I had in mind when I completed a politics degree a few years
earlier. I remember my mum being on the phone to a friend, whom she'd known for
30 years, and telling her, ""She wants to go to university, Vicky. I know! Oh
wait for it; it gets better. She wants to study politics. God knows what's got
into her.""

It's true when they say politics is showbusiness for ugly people. I would never
have made a career in fashion or the arts or academia. I wasn't clever, stylish
or creative enough. But in politics, surrounded by geeks, I figured I might just
shine.

After a year of donkey work (and with the shocking election defeat of 2001 under
my belt), I was on the path to becoming a press officer. It was my current
business partner, Jo Tanner, a press officer herself at the time, who taught me
everything I know. We were the only south Londoners in the place and we stuck
out a mile. I once stormed in to see my boss, Nick Wood, and asked him if I
needed elocution lessons. He drew on a fag, took a gulp of wine and said, ""And
be like all those other f***ers? No, love, stay as you are.""

We were doing jobs way above our pay grades but there simply wasn't anyone else
to do it. More than 20 of my former colleagues are now either MPs or lords. One
minute I would be photocopying, the next I would be on a plane to Manchester
accompanying Iain Duncan Smith on a visit, covering for his press officer who
was on leave. (I went for the job but he chose the posh one. I can't complain -
she was good and clever.) I remember after IDS did an interview, he asked me
what I thought of it. I said that I thought it wasn't great and that I had seen
him perform better in previous ones. I'm not sure he had ever been told this
before - he looked devastated. It was at that moment that I decided I would
never be a ""yes"" man (or woman). Westminster is full of people who will tell you
how wonderful you are, how clever you sound and how millions of people want you
to be prime minister rather than anyone else. It's all bollocks, I'm afraid -
and the yes men are doing politicians a massive disservice. If I can't be
trusted to tell the truth, there is simply no point me being there.

I then went on to work for Theresa May, who at the time was shadow transport
secretary and then the first female party chairman. The party chairman position
was a role made for May - she suited the organised nature of the job and never
once moaned when she had to spend her spare evenings and weekends at a Tory
function in the middle of nowhere. With her leopard-print shoes and love of
fashion, she also brought a sense of style and glamour to the party which had
been too white, male and pale for too long.

She told me that she wanted to be bold in her speech at the party conference in
2002, but I had no idea that we would still be talking about that ""nasty"" party
speech 15 years later. She took to the stage and socked it to the Tory
membership, saying that people viewed us as the nasty party and that we needed
to prove they were wrong. She didn't believe that Conservatives were nasty, but
knew that's what people thought of us. But before she could explain those
comments, the damage was done. She had offended them. For the next six months,
Theresa May went around the country attending rubber-chicken dinners justifying
that line in her speech. She was right, of course, but ahead of her time and
those Tory members just didn't want to hear it.

For several years, I'd earned less than 20,000, working in London. It was a
struggle - I would use the money given to me by my bosses for their coffees to
tide me over until payday. I decided enough was enough and pushed for a pay
rise. Nothing was forthcoming so I left. I then found myself at ITV News, as
deputy head of press when the Iraq war broke out in March 2003. I remember
calling Iain Duncan Smith, Tory party leader at the time, to tell him that we
had reports coming in of ships dispatching planes and his adviser, my old boss,
arguing with me that it couldn't be true because Tony Blair hadn't called. I
think it's safe to say that I told IDS, the leader of the opposition, about the
Iraq war before the prime minister.

Later, I went on to work at Channel 4 News where I was introduced as the ""token
Tory"" to guests who arrived in the studio. When I got the call to come back to
the Tories to be a senior press officer to David Davis, the shadow home
secretary, I pushed them for more money - I had heard he was difficult to work
for. I ended up doubling my salary within two years of leaving Tory HQ and went
back on ten grand more than most of the other press officers.

It was dubbed danger money because nobody else at the time was nuts enough to
work for DD. And, boy, was he a hard taskmaster. He once called me at 2am and
asked what was I doing. ""Sleeping, you moron,"" was my reply. Although, looking
back, for a single girl in her mid-twenties, that was a pretty sad answer. I
should have been in a nightclub at that time, or hanging from a chandelier
having some fun. But I was heartbroken from losing my fianc in a car crash a
couple of years earlier, and so Davis reaped the rewards of me being dedicated
to my work. I'd pretty much do as he said, including working around the clock
(an 11-day spell of little sleep, pizza at our desks and sending a helper out
for clean underwear from M&S was a particular low point). But every now and then
I would put him back in his place and I secretly think he liked it.

I stayed for around 18 months and then decided to go freelance, taking on PR
projects. I couldn't see a time when we would ever get back into government and
felt I needed to do something for myself for once. I carried on with the
freelance projects and set up a new business called The Research Shop with Nick
Timothy. It was a business we ran in tandem with our day jobs, to provide
corporates with genius researchers who knew where to find the information they
needed, quickly. The business made a grand profit of 17k before we folded it.
We realised it was harder than it looked to make two full-time salaries this
way.

I got to the point where I had taken on so much freelance work that I was
burning the candle at both ends. I ended up with acute tonsillitis. I realised I
couldn't do this on my own - and I was lonely. I persuaded Jo Tanner, who was
head of press at the British Chambers of Commerce, to join me. We both worked
night shifts at the Conservative Party so we didn't take a salary from the
business for six months - although I would be terrible at being late for morning
meetings having slept in from the night shift the day before. I remember on one
shift, David Cameron called at 3am to tell me he needed to change his timings
for GMTV. I answered the phone at the same time as my other half said, ""I don't
care if it's the f***ing Queen. Who the hell calls at 3am?"" Cameron graciously
replied, ""I think you would get the same answer out of Samantha at this time of
the morning, to be honest, so I don't blame him.""

We finally banked enough money to give up work full time and pour ourselves into
the company. We were just over a year into the business when we had an approach
from Nick Boles, who is now MP for Grantham, to run his campaign to be the
Conservative candidate for mayor of London against Ken Livingstone in 2008. The
Tories were very unlikely to make a dent in Livingstone's campaign for
re-election, but Boles was determined to give it a go. We set up an office, but
soon after he became unwell and had to withdraw from the race. He called Jo and
I and asked us to go and see Boris Johnson immediately, who was considering
throwing his hat into the ring.

I arrived as Boris was on the phone to the Evening Standard, umming and ahhing.
I told him to get off the phone. He then asked us why he should hire us, so I
turned the tables and asked him to pitch to us why he wanted to be mayor of
London. He gave it his best shot, but it needed some polish, to put it politely.
We were hired and went on to work on the campaign for ten months alongside
Australian strategist Lynton Crosby. Boris had star quality - Londoners wanted
to touch him in the street, and women asked for their breasts to be autographed.
I had never seen a reaction like it. If you watch Boris on YouTube winning the
election in 2008, you will hear a massive scream in the background. That's me -
not just because we proved all those (men) wrong who said we were silly girls
who were not up to it, but because I'd done a bonus deal with the Tories on
winning and now I could afford a new kitchen.

The Boris win launched us, although we then spent a few years starting families
- when one was off having a baby, the other would be at work and vice versa. We
slowly grew the team. I worked pro bono for Women2Win, the group set up by
Theresa May and Baroness Jenkin to get more Conservative female MPs. At one
party conference, I came up with a idea to bung the hotel manager fifty quid for
him to turn a blind eye while I went around every floor in the hotel, hanging
signs on each room door saying ""I need a woman!"" and, on the back, ""To be my
MP"". I thought it would get them talking at breakfast. Vicar's daughter Mrs May
had reservations and decided against the idea, but not before I had already
ordered and paid for 1,000 of them. I binned them at my own cost and learnt a
valuable if costly lesson.

I'd been around the Conservative machine for more than 15 years, but decided
that when David Cameron called the EU referendum in 2016, I wouldn't take part
on either side. I was a reluctant Remainer but I kept myself to myself. In the
weeks that followed that Brexit result, I offered my services to Theresa May,
believing that she would be the right candidate to steer us through a very
difficult period. I told my business partner that I would be back in two months
maximum. The campaign lasted little more than three weeks and, in July 2016,
Theresa May was the new PM.

The next few days were a whirlwind. I had been asked repeatedly to become the
director of communications at No 10 but was unsure because of the business and
because of my young family. Deep down I knew I wanted it, so I trusted my gut
and jumped.

The day I walked into No 10 was the day I ran out of time for anything else
other than politics. I got up at 5.30am every day, was at my desk by 7.15am, and
I would be back home in time to wolf down some dinner and then watch the 10
o'clock news. Everyone did the same. We flew to China, India, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey and America twice (meeting two American presidents in the space of six
months). On the way back from India, news was coming in that Donald Trump just
might win the presidency. I scrapped my planned night out at the US Embassy
party and instead went to a hotel to grab some sleep. The next morning, I was
blow-drying my hair in my office when the PM came to find me to agree on the
quote we would issue. It was a surreal moment, curling my hair with hot irons
while we discussed her reaction to the new leader of the free world. If my
friends from Erith School could have seen me, they would have choked on their
toast.

Mrs May's speech outside No 10 after becoming prime minister last year was
everything I believed in, and everything I signed up to be a part of. I hung it
on my wall in my office. I should have known it wasn't going to be that simple.
For months I grappled daily with the destructive nature of the PM's joint chiefs
of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, and when she finally called the election,
I knew it was my way out. They made it clear they didn't want me and my
opinions, and the feeling was mutual. I knew their behaviour couldn't last for
ever and that they would, at some point, implode. Hill had a track record for
bullishness; she had to leave the Home Office a few years back. But even I
didn't know it would unravel this quickly.

Despite it being a horrendous ten months of my life, I don't have any regrets.
I've learnt that when the pressure is on, I can hack it.

Heck, I even organised a press conference with the president of the United
States.

I remember a time early on in Downing Street in a meeting with the prime
minister, who couldn't understand why we were getting bad press for dumping the
Northern Powerhouse initiative, a move that some suspected stemmed from it being
the ex-chancellor George Osborne's pet project. The PM told us clearly that she
supported the Northern Powerhouse and had appointed a minister for it, so where
had this story come from? The room fell silent. Only 48 hours before had we been
told by Fiona Hill to strip out any references to the Northern Powerhouse in the
PM's speeches or pieces.

Working with Hill was infuriating. She would go through the Downing Street grid
- a Tony Blair innovation, consisting of a diary setting out every department
and ministry's agenda for the week ahead - and identify plans that needed more
work, when I suspected it was because she hadn't read the detail or given her
feedback on them yet. She would ask the most basic questions which made me
believe that, unlike the rest of us, she probably hadn't stayed up until 1am to
understand it all. I would get ripped apart in another meeting for presiding
over an empty grid, which wasn't empty until she had got her hands on it. When
the grid was brilliant, the team who managed it were congratulated. When the
grid was crap, it was the fault of the communications team, run by yours truly.
It was like an episode of The Thick of It.

We would be told by Hill to freeze out certain members of the press and although
I did my best to ignore her mad requests, it was sometimes more than our jobs
were worth to go against her demands. So we would, on instruction, occasionally
go cool on a particular person, only to find that she had been meeting with them
herself for coffee in the same week. I would look like the arrogant one and she
would come across as friendly.

It was pointless and a drain on resources.

I remember The Times writing a true story about Hill sending offensive text
messages to cabinet members and, on a Sunday night at midnight, her shouting at
me down the phone asking me ""what the f***"" I was going to do about it. She
demanded an apology and retraction from The Times and I had to write to the
editor. She demanded she saw a copy of my letter before it went. I'm told that
letter made the editor's day. He knew he was in the right and I didn't have a
leg to stand on and the whole affair was ridiculous. But I had to go through the
motions to keep her happy.

Once, the PM was getting ready to do an interview with The Sunday Times
Magazine. I had seen her to brief her on potential questions and asked the PM if
she needed hair, make-up or a stylist. She was grateful for hair and make-up
(what woman wouldn't be?), but declined the stylist, saying she would bring her
own clothes to the shoot. As the PM generally looks great, I was happy to agree.

The night before, just as we were about to go home, Fiona Hill came storming
down to my office, a rare treat, and told me and my team that we'd failed once
again in not preparing the PM for the interview the next day. ""Where are the
f***ing hydrangeas?"" One of my colleagues had already been up to the PM's flat
to get it ready for the shoot but apparently we had failed miserably because we
hadn't ordered flowers. My secretary was sent out to buy some at 7pm with my
credit card. I've just remembered that Downing Street still owes me the money
for those. Mumbling about how shit we all were, I then overheard Hill on the
phone to the designer Amanda Wakeley, begging her to send over a vanful of
clothes the next morning for the PM to choose from. I was told by Hill that it
was a big mistake to take the PM at her word with regards to her clothes -
stupid me. I asked the PM and got an answer back; I didn't realise that I was
meant to ignore her.

The next morning, dressed in a leopardprint skirt and Gucci heels, Hill was in
full swing at the shoot. I left, because there was nothing for me to do. All
went well until later, when one of my colleagues popped into my office to tell
me that we may have a problem: did I know the outfit the PM finally chose cost
two grand? And there lies the story of the brown leather trousers she was
wearing in the shoot. I hit the roof. This was a PR screw-up that was wholly
avoidable. I didn't even like the bloody trousers - they were the wrong kind of
brown, if you know what I mean.

At Downing Street, I would spend weeks trying to get messages across to the
public about what we were trying to achieve. That is harder than it sounds. I
sat down at the end of that week with a glass of wine in my hand and watched
Have I Got News For You, where they ripped the piss out of Trousergate. I turned
over, to find the same on Gogglebox. Hill had succeeded where I had failed.

I know what people will be thinking reading this: how the hell did Hill get away
with it? And why did we let her? Months later, I'm still trying to figure out
the answer to that question. When members of the cabinet are not standing up to
her, how did I have a chance? When the prime minister backs her joint chief of
staff 100 per cent, where do you go to complain? I've spent nearly two decades
in politics and I've never been afraid of anything or anyone. Until now. Looking
back, it was www.ludicrous.No wonder my partner couldn't understand it and
begged me to leave.

I knew that without these two chiefs of staff, Theresa May would never have
become prime minister. They were there for her the whole way - as home secretary
and into No 10 - but by the very nature of the way they acted, I knew they would
also be her downfall. And they very nearly were.

She now has the uneviable task of trying to run the country without any decent
majority, run a cabinet without any authority and deliver on a Brexit decision
she never agreed with in the first place. She has an amazing sense of public
duty and will see this through, for as long as we want her, for she is now a
prisoner of the Conservative Party. In the meantime, the Conservative brand
becomes more toxic by the week - unless she can find a way to deliver on the
promises she made in that speech that hung in my office: to tackle the stigma of
mental health; to drive out racial inequality in Britain. I hope she leaves this
legacy rather than one of a Brexit PM with a car crash of an election campaign.
She deserves more than that.

But she let two people ruin the very thing she always wanted more than anything
- to be prime minister - and for that she has to take some responsibility. I
feel bad even writing this, but on reflection, Theresa May is the one who owes
me an apology. I gave up everything for her - even seeing my own kids - and I
got nothing in return.

As for me, I crammed all this into less than 20 years' working in Westminster
and I'm not even 40 yet. I have at least 20 years left in this business. I live

target to spend 0.7% of GDP on foreign aid, the chancellor was in high spirits.

""We should all take pride in this historic moment for the country,"" said George
Osborne as he delivered his budget statement to MPs.

The government's spending commitment took years of lobbying from charities such
as Christian Aid and Oxfam among others as well as campaign groups like the One
Campaign and the Bond group of NGOs. In an age of countless e-petitions,
publicity campaigns and street protests, it was a rare example of politicians
and NGO staff working together to achieve a common objective.

But how can NGOs lobby governments effectively? How do you get access to
decision-makers? What's the most effective way to contact politicians? How do
you persuade MPs to take up your cause? How do you pester an MP without
irritating them?

And what about the dangers of getting too close to power? Does collaborating
with politicians lead to an inevitable loss of effectiveness?

187886891,"Labour has backed the victims of a paedophile ring operating in an east Belfast
care home who want the scandal investigated as part of the wider Westminster
inquiry into child abusers at the heart of the British establishment.

Despite the disclosure of secret state files on abuse allegations at the
notorious Kincora Belfast boys' home, it will not prompt a government rethink on
its exclusion from a UK-wide abuse inquiry.

The Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, said the best forum to examine
claims of political involvement in a paedophile ring that operated from the
boys' home was an ongoing Stormont-established inquiry, chaired by the retired
judge Sir Anthony Hart, not the nationwide inquiry being chaired by the New
Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.

Campaigners for Kincora's inclusion in the UK-wide inquiry have highlighted that
the Northern Ireland-specific investigation does not have the powers to compel
security services witnesses to give evidence or produce documents.

""The Hart inquiry is doing an exceptionally good job,"" said Villiers. ""We feel
that it is the right forum to investigate the despicable events that took place
at Kincora.

""Like everyone else, we want to ensure that the truth is discovered, that these
events are fully investigated and we believe the Hart inquiry is the best forum
to do that.""

But her Labour counterpart, Ivan Lewis MP, insisted the government should change
course and incorporate Kincora into the Westminster inquiry.

The shadow Northern Ireland secretary said: ""The Kincora victims deserve truth
and accountability in relation to the horrendous abuse which still haunts so
many lives to this day.

""The content of these new government documents will only strengthen concern
about a potential cover up at the highest levels. These developments should
cause the Government to change course and without further delay include Kincora
in the terms of reference of the national child abuse inquiry.""

Paedophiles, including prominent Orangemen and Ulster loyalists, abused boys
from the Kincora home in east Belfast during the 1970s. While three staff
members were convicted in 1981, it has long been alleged that well-known figures
in the British establishment - including senior politicians - were also
involved.

Amnesty International is among the campaigners making fresh calls for Kincora's
inclusion in Justice Goddard's inquiry, following the discovery of a series of
confidential government files.

Amnesty's Northern Ireland director, Patrick Corrigan, questioned the
government's stance.

""Nothing less than a full public inquiry - with all the powers of compulsionthat
brings - can finally reveal what happened at Kincora,"" he said.",1,1,1
187969041,"It's one of the laws of politics that if you have something important to say,
you must leave SW1 to say it. It's about escaping from the Westminster bubble
and surrounding yourself with ""ordinary"" people in the hope that it makes you
look more normal (or, in Ed Miliband's case, semi-normal).

Location, location, location. I can just hear the brainstorming session over
where Ed should go for his Big Welfare Idea.

""It has to be gritty,"" says one man. ""But not too gritty,"" says another. ""It
can't be West, that's too Westminster,"" says another man (Ed's team is a bit
male).

""I know, let's go East, but to the new shiny bit!"" said another.

So that is how we all ended up going on an awfully big adventure to Newham
Dockside, a giant tin can on the Thames that is so shiny that there are signs in
the lifts that say: ""Inspiring People"". It is, I can report, close to a
Docklands Light Railway stop called Cyprus and, no, they don't take euros there
- yet.

Ed stood in front of a window overlooking the river glittering in the sun, and
shiny City Airport. I couldn't help but notice that, from where I was sitting, a
little white luggage van kept nipping in and out of Ed's armpit. Every once in a
while a plane would head out from the side of Ed's head and, with a roar, lift
itself into the air.

I wish I could say the same for the speech. It was 36 minutes long (not that I'm
counting). Ed said, in the first minute, Labour would have to be ""laser-focused""
on how to spend every pound. What chance of that, when they can't even laser a
speech? Ed began by giving us one of those false choices that politicians
specialise in. (Do you want to boil in a vat of oil or spend the day by the pool
drinking cocktails? Gee, that's a tough one, I'll get back to you.) So here's
was Ed's choice. Did we want to remake the welfare system so it worked better,
was fair and sustainable? (As he said that, a little white van reversed over his
elbow).

Or? ""Take the Conservative way,"" he said ominously. This was, he explained,
ripping away the safety net, dividing the country and generally getting drunk on
Bolly and eating Eton mess.

Hmmm. Ed explained that he had ""planks"". These were not just any planks. They
were ""One Nation"" planks. One of the planks was housing. He's building more,
possibly with planks. I had a vision of entire estates of One Nation houses,
made up of planks and shiny little signs that said ""Inspiring People"".

I looked around: the One Nation crowd was fighting narcolepsy. I don't think
even Ed was enjoying himself (but who would with all that traffic in your
armpit?). Forget One Nation Labour. This was One Nation Be-Laboured. Ed revved
himself up for the final series of ""inspirational"" sentences which coincided
with a plane taking off from his right ear.

There was a question session for the press and the ordinary people. After two
media questions about Labour tax affairs, Ed searched the room. ""I'm desperately
looking for an ordinary person,"" he said.

Finally he found her. ""What,"" demanded a woman, ""will One Nation Labour do for
suburbia?"" Ed looked, for just a moment, frightened. Real people can do that to
you. But surely Ed, that is the key. Forget new homes. What about new gnomes?
Surely it's time to give the little people a chance.",1,1,1

Survey reveals councils acquiring properties across the UK for vulnerable
families due to welfare cuts and high London rents

FULL TEXT

Local authorities in London are preparing to send thousands of homeless families
to live in temporary homes outside the capital, in defiance of ministerial
demands that people should continue to be housed locally.

Councils are acquiring properties across Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire,
Sussex, and further afield to cope with an expected surge in numbers of
vulnerable families presenting as homeless as a result of welfare cuts from next
April.

They say booming rents across the capital, coupled with the introduction next
April of stringent benefit caps, leave them in an impossible position, with no
option but to reluctantly kickstart an exodus of poorer families from the
capital by placing homeless households in cheaper areas often many miles from
their home borough.

Draft guidance issued by ministers in May says councils must ""as far as is
reasonably practicable"" secure accommodation for homeless families within their
own borough. This was ordered by the then housing minister Grant Shapps in the
wake of reports that Newham council planned to relocate households to
Stoke-on-Trent, a proposal Shapps, now Conservative party chairman, described as
""unfair and wrong"".

But Guardian research shows London councils have acquired rental properties in
Luton, Northampton, Broxbourne, Gravesend, Dartford, Slough, Windsor, Margate,
Hastings, Epping Forest, Thurrock, and Basildon, and are considering
accommodation as far away as Manchester, Hull, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham,
and Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales.

Councils said the exodus of homeless families was inevitable because there is
virtually no suitable private rented temporary accommodation for larger families
in London that is affordable within government-imposed housing benefit
allowances, which are capped at a maximum 400 a week.

""It is going to be practically impossible to provide affordable accommodation to
meet our homelessness duties in London. As the pressures increase we will be
looking to procure well out of London, and even out of the home counties,"" said
Ken Jones, director of housing and strategy at Barking and Dagenham council in
east London.

All but four of the 33 London boroughs responded to the Guardian survey.
Seventeen said they are already placing homeless families outside the capital,
or have secured or are considering temporary accommodation outside London for
future use.

These included Kensington and Chelsea, which has already moved a minority of
homeless families to Manchester and Slough; Waltham Forest, which has acquired
housing in Luton, Margate and Harlow; Brent, which has relocated some households
to Hastings; and Tower Hamlets which has relocated a handful of families to
Northampton.

Hackney council, which said it currently manages to house 93% of families
accepted as homeless within the borough, and the remainder elsewhere in the
capital, said it was now ""reluctantly looking to procure accommodation outside
London"".

Councils expect a wave of legal challenges from homeless residents who will cite
government guidance to argue that their offer of accommodation outside the
capital is ""unsuitable"" because of the negative impact it will have on their
health, or their children's education, according to a new study published by the
charity Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG).

The CPAG report warns that thousands of homeless families already placed in
expensive temporary accommodation in the capital will now face being uprooted
for a second time. Councils could face the choice of picking up the bill for the
rent shortfall for these households - expected to run to tens of millions of
pounds a year - or moving the families to cheaper homes outside the capital.

Alison Garnham, CPAG chief executive, said: ""Families are facing the impossible
situation of being told to move to cheaper accommodation that just doesn't exist
with London's rising rents. London boroughs are staring at a black hole in their
budgets as a result, with costs transferred from central to local government.

""There's still time for government to do the sensible thing and think again when
these reforms are debated in parliament before thousands of London's families
find themselves uprooted, overcrowded and thrown into turmoil.""

MPs are expected to debate regulations which will set out the detail of how the
benefit cap will work at a Commons legislation committee meeting on Tuesday.

Government guidance states: ""Homeless households may not always be able to stay
in their previous neighbourhoods. However the government considers that it is
not acceptable for local authorities to make compulsory placements automatically
hundreds of miles away, without having proper regard for the disruption this may
cause to those households.""

The CPAG report, based on detailed interviews with 11 London local authorities,
also found many working households will also face substantial income shortfalls
as a result of housing benefit caps. Councils report that families are reluctant
to move if this would disrupt their childrens' schooling or cut them off from
relatives and friends, triggering fears this could lead to a surge in
overcrowding as families improvise by sharing properties or trading down to
smaller flats.

Although it had been anticipated that affordable private rents in expensive
inner city areas such as Westminster would be scarce, the acute housing shortage
in the capital means market rents outstrip benefit cap levels in cheaper outer
London boroughs including Haringey, Waltham Forest, and Barking and Dagenham.

Families have already begun to move from inner London to the capital's outer
boroughs, with more expected from this month as transitional support for
families affected by the housing benefit caps runs out. The government had hoped
that the housing benefit reforms would force landlords to reduce rents to within
cap limits.

But councils say the spiralling demand for private rented property from tenants
priced out of the housing market means most landlords see no reason to drop
rents, and a substantial number say they will no longer consider renting to
people who are claiming housing benefit.

Some councils have estimated that up to a third of families affected by the
introduction of the 26,000 benefit cap, the local housing allowance cap and
under-occupation penalties, known as the ""spare room tax"", will lose around 100
a week. They face the option of finding work, moving into smaller and cheaper
accommodation, or presenting to the local authority as homeless.

Most authorities have attempted to identify and advise residents at risk of
losing income as a result of welfare changes. But there is acceptance among
officials that many of the families affected will have few options.

One cabinet member for housing in an inner city borough said: ""Let's face it, a
lot of people with more than two or three children, and who are dependent on
benefits in this borough are not going to be here for very much longer.""

Although ministers have introduced a 165m discretionary housing fund for London
councils in 2013-14 to help families who can make a special case for staying,
the CPAG report estimates that this is inadequate and amounts to less than 10%
of the shortfall in benefit income caused by benefit changes.

Councils say some of the households who will be hit by the benefit cap have also
been identified by them as needing support under the ""troubled families"" scheme.
But they fear a public backlash if they prioritise them for discretionary
housing payments because this would send out a signal that ""problematic
behaviour was being rewarded"".

 More benefit sanctions mean more suffering for those who live on the edge,
warns Rick Henderson Local authorities must exempt victims of domestic abuse

On my radar ...

 Homecare. Charity Leonard Cheshire says two-thirds of local councils are
commissioning 15-minute visits for people with disabilities and older people,
despite concerns these periods deprive them of essential care. Using data
gathered from freedom of information requests, Leonard Cheshire, the largest
voluntary sector provider of disabled care, found that in the past five years
the proportion of visits lasting a quarter of an hour or shorter had risen by
15%. The charity, which announced earlier this year that it would not be bidding
for contracts that included 15-minute calls, wants to see an end to 15-minute
care visits.

Writing for the Information Daily, Sandie Keene, president of the Association of
Directors of Adult Social Services, argues that in some cases, 15-minute visits
to older people at home are fully justified, and fully adequate. An ADASS survey
last year found that only half of councils commission homecare by 15 minute
visits, she adds, and more than four-fifths of those that do use these visits to
administer medication.

The Community Care blog notes that an amendment to the care bill, which is being
debated in the House of Lords this week, could prevent councils from
commissioning visits of less than 30 minutes for personal care. For more on the

 A new report published by Victim Support on the criminal victimisation of
people with mental health problems. It says people with mental illnesses are
three times more likely to be victims of crime than the general population.
Victims told researchers that their reports to the police were often dismissed
or disbelieved. On his Mental Health Cop blog, Michael Brown says the research
""deserves to be taken extremely seriously"". He adds:

This report just documents what I've long known and all too often seen: that the
service given to victims with mental health disorders is not as consistent as
those given to victims without. More importantly, it documents the extent to
which victims become victims because they live with mental health disorders and
the extent to which people are often targeted precisely because offenders know
that the criminal justice system will, more often than otherwise, fail to
deliver a case against them into a court room.This is why the criminal justice
system needs to go the extra yard, to combat the stigma that pervades us all.

 The work capability assessment. The Disability News Service reports that the
minister for disabled people says she would not rule out scrapping the
government's ""fitness for work"" test. Esther McVey said the WCA - which tests
eligibility for out-of-work disability benefits - could be replaced if there was
proof that it had fallen below a certain standard.

 How  local government might look in 50 years' time. On the We Love Local
Government blog, Glen Ocsko makes some predictions, including:

Local government will have massively more power to determine its own fate. More
local taxes will be in place, with minimal handouts from central government to
balance out low income areas. This will in turn lead to far greater
discrepancies between areas in terms of services and quality standards.

187884121,"The Scottish government has announced a moratorium on all planning consents for
unconventional oil and gas extraction, including fracking.

Welcomed by campaigners as ""a very big nail in the coffin for the unconventional
gas and fracking industry in Scotland"", energy minister Fergus Ewing told the
Scottish parliament on Wednesday afternoon that the moratorium would allow time
for the government to launch a full public consultation on the controversial
drilling technique, and to commission a full public health impact assessment.

Westminster MPs on Monday defeated an attempt to impose a UK-wide moratorium but
the coalition government had to accept several Labour proposals to tighten
regulation of shale developments.

""Given the importance of this work it would be inappropriate to allow any
planning consents in the meantime,"" Ewing told the Holyrood chamber, to
applause. ""I am therefore announcing a moratorium for the granting of planning
consents on all unconventional oil and gas extraction including fracking."" He
said that the Scottish government would also be working to further strengthen
planning guidance and strong environmental regulation.

Acknowledging that local communities would bear the brunt of any developments,
Ewing said that a public consultation ""will allow everyone with a view to feed
it in to government"".

He added that the government would take evidence from all interested parties,
including chemical giant Ineos which owns Grangemouth oil and gas refinery and
has acquired 729 square miles of fracking exploration licences around the
central belt.

Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, described the
announcement as a ""huge victory for the communities, individuals and groups who
have been campaigning to stop this dirty industry in Scotland"".

He added that he believed any serious examination of the mounting evidence would
inevitably lead to a ban.

""The Scottish government has acted decisively today to protect communities
across the country and the environment from this unnecessary industry.

""While we are calling for an outright ban, a halt on the industry while a full
examination of health and environmental impacts is carried out is very welcome.
Scotland joins France, Ireland, the Netherlands and New York State in a long
list of countries and regions which have acted to stop the unconventional gas
industry. We are convinced that a proper examination of the mounting evidence of
health and environmental concerns must lead to a full ban.""

Asked in the Holyrood chamber by Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone why he
would not impose an outright ban on fracking, Ewing reiterated that the Scottish
government wanted ""a national debate which is characterised by examining the
evidence"". He said that the moratorium would apply until process of evidence
gathering and consultation has been concluded, and that the public consultation
was likely to be launched within the next two months.

WWF Scotland director Lang Banks also welcomed the Scottish government's
decision to impose the UK's first moratorium on onshore unconventional oil and
gas, but cautioned that it did not fully shut the door on new fossil fuel
extraction.

""There is overwhelming public opinion in favour of cleaner forms of energy and a
sufficient body of evidence why unconventional oil and gas are neither good for
people or the planet. While this rightly puts a hold on fracking for now, we
hope the final decision will be to rule it out completely.""

The Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy wrote to first minister Nicola Sturgeon on
Monday, urging her to adopt his party's triple lock proposal on fracking, which
includes a local referendum before final planning approval is given. The SNP in
turn criticised Scottish Labour MPs for failing to support Monday's amendment to
the infrastructure bill calling for a UK-wide moratorium, which the majority of
SNP MPs voted for.

Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog, the trade body that represents the sector,
said that industry welcomed the consultation. ""We recognise that the general
public have concerns about the issues around fracking and welcome this
opportunity to present the facts to the Scottish people. Many independent
reports, including the independent panel set up by the Scottish government, have
commented that a robust regulatory process is substantially in place. Scotland
needs to produce its own oil and gas for both economic and energy security
reasons.""

Public opposition to fracking in Scotland, which gained a high profile during
last summer's independence referendum campaign, has grown in momentum over the
past six months with local opposition groups forming in particular around the
central belt where Ineos was concentrating its activities. An online poll by
Usurv of public opinion on fracking across the UK found that Scots were most
likely to oppose the practice, with 54% saying they were against it, and less
than 8% happy for it to happen elsewhere.

Full control over fracking is due to be devolved to Scotland after May's general
election, following recommendations of last November's Smith commission. On
Tuesday, the Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said that he believed that
fracking licensing should also be devolved to Wales, and that the Welsh
parliament should consider a moratorium on fracking.",0,0,0
187974724,"No wonder Michelle Mone has got everyone's knickers in a twist Ablonde, divorced
Scottish woman with a world-famous cleavage is about to join the House of Lords
and every last person in Britain seems to have it in for her.

But Michelle Mone - or Baroness Mone of Mayfair, as she will be known, is surely
everything that a functioning democracy ought to be proud of. My Fight to the
Top - the blood, sweat and tear-saturated autobiography she published this March
- details her rise from the lowest ranks of squalid poverty in Glasgow's East
End to here, a London pad with a large balcony overlooking the Thames. She's
already designed her coat of arms: a Scottish deer and a labrador - in memory of
Ozzie, the family's much loved dog, who died last year.

This morning Michelle Mone, 44, is done up to the nines but rather stiff when I
first meet her. I can understand why. The tabloids oohed and aahed all over her
in the years she built Ultimo, her bra company, into a global brand from
scratch. But now that David Cameron has unexpectedly fast-tracked her to the
very apex of the British establishment, a shiver of what one might interpret as
stricken horror seems to be passing down the spines of members of that elite
club: posh Dave has gone all weak-kneed, is the assumption, under the steady
gaze of this newly minted bra boss. There's the view, also, that she's going to
make a mockery, just by being there, of the Upper House.

And it's for these reasons that, since Cameron's announcement in August, the
muckrakers have been working overtime. She's a fibber, they allege, prone to
exaggerate the degree of both her own achievements and the size of her company's
profits; she's a PR machine on steroids; she made sure that Ultimo benefited
from a ""morally questionable"" tax avoidance arrangement; the life peerage is a
pay-off - for having been one of the tiny handful of famous Scots to come out so
vocally against Scottish independence in the run-up to the referendum earlier
this year. Plus, Rod Stewart called her ""a manipulative cow"". That last bit is
true.

Proof that her critics were right, they said, came last month in the form of a
tweet. She'd been travelling in a tax-funded government Jaguar (which is out of
character, as Mone is actually Bentley's global ambassador), when she decided
not only to drape her top on the car's heater but to take a picture of it, along
with the words, ""The things you do in Government car drying my travel top love
it so much. See you soon #Stockport #betheboss."" She's since deleted the tweet.

She was in the car in the first place because of another Tory brainwave: shortly
before she was announced as a life peer, Iain Duncan Smith announced that Mone
was going to be the country's new start-up tsar, with ten months to deliver her
recommendations.

Even the people who admire her fret that she's joined a doomed political conga
line. Cameron seems to have made a habit of choosing glamorous women for
high-profile shopkeeping roles that go nowhere, making Carol Vorderman a maths
tsar, Tamara Mellon, the Jimmy Choo founder, a global trade ambassador and
Karren Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham, an ambassador for small businesses.

Nothing much seems to have come of these vague roles. Mary Portas's high-profile
appointment as high street rejuvenator ended in a damp squib - one gets the
impression that her recommendations were sidelined.

Now it's Mone's turn to be put on a pedestal, and before long ... discarded?
Douglas Anderson, who runs the GAP Group, a plant hire company, went public to
say Cameron had ""lost his marbles"", elevating Mone to the House of Lords. He
described her as a ""small-time businesswoman"" who'd done practically nothing to
boost British employment. ""Because she is flogging bras and knickers she gets PR
way ahead of anything she should get,"" he grumbled.

""I mean,"" says Mone in her steady voice, when I read this quote out to her, ""I
don't know who he is to begin with. I can't stand people who say things when
they have never met you and don't know you and don't know what investments you
have, and everything else."" The House of Lords gig is a job, not a photo
opportunity, she says. ""I want to do really well in the House of Lords. I want
to contribute. I'm going to go in there and learn the ropes and progress.""

Anderson's is not the first slight that's been thrown Mone's way. ""I would just
say that, with me - I don't know why - there has been a lot of jealousy and a
lot of negative comments."" She's not bothered. ""That's just life. I'm not one to
sit with a box of tissues and cry myself to sleep."" It does seem to get under
her skin, though. ""The criticism - it's as if I have robbed a bank.""

For the record all she's ever done is roll up her sleeves, and ""work really,
really hard"".

""I've never asked anyone for any favours.

Never asked anyone for anything. And I can assure you it will be a brilliant
review."" She delivers everything she says evenly, calmly, unblinkingly - she
really can hold that gaze for a long time. ""Just stare them in the eye.

And stare at them. And stare at them,"" was Grandpa Mone's advice if ever little
Michelle worried about having her pocket money stolen in one of the tenements
where she grew up. ""When they look away - you've won.""

Is it possible, in these explicit days, that the great and the good still find
underwear unsettling? ""Yes. I mean, if I was designing the pen that you're
holding now, I don't think I would be getting as much flak as I am getting. But
I'm not going to sit here and say poor me. I've courted the media for many
years.""

She is four shots (coffee) into her morning, which, like every morning, began at
5.30, was built on a maximum of five hours of sleep, and kicked off with a gym
session with her trainer - her goal is to achieve the personal fitness of a
professional footballer (male). Her OBE hangs framed in her hall.

The open-plan lounge, where we're sitting on an L-shaped sofa, has views of the
river. This is a clutter-free zone, thanks to Mone's obsessive compulsive
disorder. How is her OCD these days? She laughs but - ""I'm going to tell you the
truth: that cushion over there is annoying me a wee bit."" Which one? ""The one
lying on its back on the terrace,"" she says. When Mone's three children were
growing up, ""I would take out the pencil cases and put their pencils all the
right way up. I'd get rid of the dirty rubbers and replace them with a batch of
new ones.""

So many questions. Mone's polite but coolly distant manner this morning makes me
worry that she'll shut me down when I ask them. Take the financial nose dive
Ultimo experienced while she was still fully on board. She has since sold 80 per
cent of the company and stepped down as chairman, but wasn't the company in
financial trouble since 2011? ""What is true,"" she says - her laser-beam eyes are
still on - ""is that in the six to nine months before the divorce, my husband
[with whom she set up and ran the business] was saying, 'You need to be
sectioned. You need to be locked up.'

And that had an effect on the business. Of course it did. Before that, the
company was flying and then the divorce put it in a very difficult situation. It
almost went under. It almost went bust - excuse the pun. It wasn't being managed
properly. The thing was a nightmare. And I fought my way to save the jobs and
save the brand, and I did. And I did it with not that much time to go. Now it
has 63,000 people. It's part of MAS Holdings.

Turnover is 1.4 billion; they are committed to turning it into a global brand.""

She describes herself as ""very private"", a self-description that contrasts oddly
with all the things we now know about her divorce, thanks to her autobiography.
Unusually for a life peer, she's written about how, in a fit of humiliation, she
trashed her husband's Porsche and put laxatives in his coffee the morning he was
due to go to a public event.

Mone's behaviour flared up after it emerged that Michael was having an affair
with a member of his wife's bra designing team, a woman Mone had hired. When
Mone confronted her husband, he told her she was imagining things - hence the
reference to being sectioned.

Shortly before her book was published, Michael muttered something to the effect
that nothing in it was true. Mone says ""Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?""
Michael is getting married in two weeks, to the woman he still says he wasn't
having the affair with. Mone says she has proof that he was, having obtained it
from a detective she'd hired.

She ""wishes him well"" now. They have three children. Michael Mone's wedding will
coincide with his ex wife's taking her seat in the House of Lords, almost to the
day. ""I take no prisoners"" - this is Mone describing to me her business MO. ""I
don't let people mess me about. I don't go looking for trouble, but if someone
attacks me I make sure I win before I leave. Sorry for saying that. But that's
the truth. I never, ever lose."" By the way, she's got a new boyfriend (lives
abroad, identity is still under wraps): ""I've never felt this way before.""

She's made a lot of her rags to riches story.

Mone was born in Glasgow's East End, the daughter of a printer and a home help.
Her brother died of spina bifada; her father was confined to a wheelchair. The
family were close, but so poor that when little Michelle needed a wash, her
mother had to take her to the public baths.

But, to paraphrase her autobiography, there was always something special about
Mone, even as a girl - her grandmother often said so: perhaps it was the poster
of Richard Branson that the teenage Michelle pinned over her bed; perhaps it was
the way, aged ten, she had two dozen children working for her once she'd
monopolised the paper round. She met Michael when she was 17.

He was middle class. The two of them spent their nights fantasising about how to
get rich. When Mone was 18, they had a child, then another one, then she got a
job at Labatt brewers. ""I am very, very, very competitive,"" she says, meaning
she wiped the floor with all of her colleagues. Unfortunately, Labatt found out
that she'd fibbed about her qualifications. She was the best thing that had ever
happened to the company's Scottish marketing department (see autobiography). But
they sacked her anyway.

Twenty-four and jobless, it occurred to Mone that she could never find a
comfortable push-up bra. Then - she happened to be in Florida - she came across
a squidgy silicone substance, ""chicken fillets,"" as they became known in the
biz. It was her lightbulb moment. There she was, a completely unknown bra
inventor, persuading Selfridges to give Ultimo - sounded classy and Italian - a
whirl.

Sales went through the roof on Day 1. This was because Mone had hired a group of
actors to picket the department store: they'd dressed up as plastic surgeons
who'd lost their livelihood because of the Ultimo bras. The stunt was all over
the news. And then America went nuts for the bras as well. There'd been an
article in the New York Post, she says, stating that Julia Roberts owed her
juicy cleavage in Erin Brockovich to an Ultimo bra. ""Like Erin, I had to fight
and learn not to take no for an answer,"" Mone told journalists when they called
her for a quote. The bras were a worldwide phenomenon (this is still Mone
talking). Flat-chested women came up to her in the street to give thanks.

Her other love when growing up, besides Richard Branson, was Dynasty. She longed
for that life, and when she and Michael hit the jackpot, she got it: spiral
staircases, expensive cars, a house with a turret. Money went to her head. She
became a diva, an alcoholic, fat, suicidal. Ultimo had taken over her life.
She'd be lying in bed next to Michael at night, on her BlackBerry. Her marriage
was falling apart; her OCD was rampant: she had four dishwashers installed in
her home. A mark of her newfound happiness is that she gets by on just the one
dishwasher these days.

Mone is recognised on the street because of another one of her publicity stunts.
Four years ago, she found the perfect model for her new bra campaign: herself.
""I was on a beach with [the model and Rod Stewart's ex wife] Rachel Hunter - she
said, 'Michelle, when you lose the weight, do a shoot to show women what can be
done and encourage them.'"" She was at the time unhappy, a fact that she says was
reflected by her weight. At Hunter's words, her goal-orientated spirit went into
overdive. She lost eight stone. She bought new teeth. The result was a
metaphorphosis: sweet-faced pudgy entrepreneur turns into a blonde Elizabeth
Hurley.

Photographs taken of the Mones from this period show a tanned beach blonde
goddess, usually on a red carpet, wearing a cameraready smile, an enormous
cleavage and a lot of jewellery. Next to her is a man who looks like he's been
accidentally cut and pasted into the scene direct from a cosy evening of
tellywatching in his front room. The man is Michael. They looked more natural
together before Mone had her upgrade.

One can imagine that there are among Mone's male critics a sizeable proportion
who find themselves caught between drooling over her flashy looks and wanting to
oust her from their universe - perhaps the two things are connected. Today she's
wearing Christian Louboutin wedge heels and a jumpsuit by Diane von Furstenberg,
cut into a V as deep as it is wide: the Ultimo bra she's wearing underneath
ensures that you'd have to be blind to miss her cleavage. Yes, she'd wear this
to work, she says. Sad tidings, however, for the codgers hoping to get an eyeful
on October 12. ""When it comes to the House of Lords, yeah, my wardrobe needs to
change slightly.""

We've been speaking for an hour, and Mone has relaxed. She is showing flashes of
humour, mainly when imitating the debates she often has about her career with
her mother. The worm turned when she came out against Scottish independence.
Antiunionists hated her; she says it was the first time in Scotland she felt
""unsafe"".

""My mother asked me, with the referendum, to stop talking about it publicly:
'Stop! You're getting death threats. For the sake of your family, stop please.'
And I said, 'Mum! I love what this country is all about. I love being Scottish.
I love being British. Why should we after all these years split up? It's bad for
business.' And I said, 'Mum, no!

I believe in it. And I'm not going to stop.'"" There were other reasons she moved
to London: her son, Declan, has started university in the capital (he lives at
his mum's) and her business interests are better taken care of here - fake tan,
fake jewellery, motivational speaking. There are, she says, a heap of board
positions up for grabs.

And, of course, the advisory role. Did Cameron single her out for the job
because she was a woman? ""I'm sure he's picked men as well. I don't think it
comes down to gender. It comes down to your skills set. And I'm not saying I'm
wonderful, I'm Miss the-bee's-knees - but I do have a skills set. I am talented.
I do know what I'm talking about in the areas that I specialise in. So if people
think I'm only getting it because I've got blonde hair and am wearing nice shoes
and a nice outfit, I would just say to them, 'Get in the real world.'"" Had she
been the old Mone, ""If I had turned up frumpy, there would be no trace of this.
I'm no supermodel or glamour queen but I'm not the way I used to be, which is a
size 22. I was quite frumpy then. If I was that person now, going into the House
of Lords and everything else, would I be getting this much backlash? I don't
think I would.

""But, you know, I keep fit. I'm now a size 12. I look after myself. I do love
glamorous things. I think the blonde hair has got a lot to do with it as well.""

Criticism never has the desired effect on her: it only makes her more determined
to succeed, ""because, I suppose, my whole life I've had to work hard and prove
myself"". She's also been successful despite not having a single qualification.
""I've always had the opinion it doesn't matter where you're from or whether you
have a good education or a bad one. If you've got that determination, if you
stick in there, you'll do it. Have I had to stick in there more than someone
that's gone to Eton or whatever? Possibly.""

A few months ago, the costume designer on Erin Brockovich popped up - or, more
likely, was hauled out by Mone-haters - and told the world that Julia Roberts
wasn't wearing an Ultimo bra in that film after all.

Did Mone lie?

""It's a very, very, very long time ago,"" she says. ""All I know about is the
amount of samples that we sent to the wardrobe person, who we were told adjusted
them to fit. Was I there when he did that? No. But it was all over the American
press - that's the reason I found out about it.""

Later, I look up the original American ""news story"": Ultimo can give you breasts
like Julia Roberts, it claims, but there's no mention of Roberts wearing an
Ultimo bra. It reads like a story written off the back of a press release. The
kind of press release the PR department of a lingerie company might send out.

She's raised three children. ""I would say I'm a planner and everything was
planned out to the minute. Their uniforms would get left out; the shoes would be
polished at night; their school bags would be tidied out. Every day at school
was like their first. It was like an army. Right?"" The children even had ""their
KPIs growing up"". What are KPIs? ""Key performance indicators,"" she says. The
concept amuses her but I'm 90 per cent certain she's not joking.

It is a bore that she won't say anything about any thoughts she might have had -
and she says she's already had loads - for her small business review.
Nevertheless, an idea she's had for improving diversity in the City hints at
things to come. Employers obsess to their detriment about CVs, she says. ""For
example, HSBC - wouldn't it be incredible if they were to have like an X Factor
for people who wanted to come and work there?""

The idea delights her. It's clear that it's been rattling around in her head for
some time. ""Simon Cowell started it for singing. Maybe I can start it for
business.""

Mone's mantra is ""Get out of your comfort zone."" It's why she did that lingerie
shoot. It's a mantra that, if inflicted on them by Mone, would likely terrify
the brittle bankers and businessmen of the world, not to say this country's
politicians. ""You know, if they got my CV - straight in the bin. I'll tell you
something, if I went to that open day I'd get straight through. That's what I'd
love to see, because I'm nothing on paper. In terms of qualifications.
Absolutely nothing.""

You would have thought her parents would have been thrilled about their
daughter's House of Lords appointment, but the first thing her mother said -
this is during one of the regular calls Mone has with her parents - was, ""Can't
you change your mind?"" ""We're not used to this, right?"" says Mone. ""We're from
the East End of Glasgow. My mum and dad are scared. But why can't someone come
from where I've come from and be part of the House of Lords, be part of this
country and what it stands for? Why?"" And it was her mother who told her to take
down the tweet. She remembers their exchange: ""'You cannot dry your top in a
government car! Get that down.' 'Mum!' 'Get it down.'

Then she hangs up. And, again, hindsight is a wonderful thing. I shouldn't have
removed it, because I said what I said and I'd say it again. My top was wet; we
were laughing about it. I said, 'How am I going to dry this?'"" And so she put
the air con on hot and dried it. ""And I shouldn't have done it. But for God's
sake, do we all have to be so doom and gloom? I was drying a top! OK, it was a
government car - I'm sorry. Right? But I didn't rob a bank.""

She's not getting paid for the 50 days she's taking out to draft her government
review, she reminds me. She travels economy, even though you can only charge
your laptop in first class, because everyone in government travels economy too,
she says.

You have to hold yourself back a bit, as a businesswoman, she says. ""Don't get
me wrong, but some of the amazing business guys out there - Lord Alan Sugar, Sir
Philip Green - if I were to say some of the things they say or do, I would be an
absolute bitch. And they seem to get applauded for it.""

Rod Stewart, I say. Didn't he describe you as a ... I read out the words
hesitantly, ""'Manipulative cow'?"" The friction arose between the rocker and the
bra designer when Mone hired Stewart's ex wife, Rachel Hunter, to replace his
girlfriend, Penny Lancaster, as the new face, and breasts, of Ultimo.

She must have known what would happen? ""Yeah. I'm not going to sit here and lie
to you. I'm going to tell you as it is. And, yes, it was planned. Why was it
planned? Because I was - phhhhwww"" - she makes the sound of a jet taking off -
""straight out there with the business. I would have done anything - nothing
illegal or anthing - for that business. And at some point I almost died for the
business, because it sucked me in so much that I took pills and almost ended it
all because I couldn't cope any more. I did it for the business. I did it for
the team. I did it for the brand and I knew it was going to create lots of
publicity.""

The campaign was ""huge"", she is saying now. ""It was all over the world. Do I
feel bad about upsetting Rod? Yeah. I replaced his girlfriend with his ex wife.
I didn't create a crime."" This is exactly the kind of ruthless business tactic,
she says, that men carry off and women aren't supposed to. ""It was a business
decision. Would I do it again? Yeah.""

She had to buy her husband out of the business. ""You couldn't make it up: in a
board meeting, food flying across the table.""

Being cheated on is terrible, she says. ""I was her boss! Every minute of the
day. It was bad."" I can't imagine, I say, but Mone hasn't finished. ""And she
lives in your guesthouse! And when you get in having been on the red eye, and
coming in and seeing her sitting in your kitchen. With a bottle of red wine.
Yes. It was tough."" She throws off the memory with a laugh. ""I'm so over it
now.""

Tax avoidance? ""I have not done anything wrong. I use a big accountancy firm in
Scotland. They've looked after me for 12 years. I have checked with them since
the divorce - 'Have I done anything that I shouldn't have done?' 'Michelle, no.'
And everyone knows my ex dealt with all the finance and dealt with all the
lawyers. I was never, ever allowed to get involved in his side and he never got
involved in my side."" They wouldn't let her in to the House of Lords, she says,
if they hadn't checked her out.

""A Tory poster girl,"" she's been called. This surprises her. ""I believe in what
they're doing. But when I don't think they're doing a good job, am I still going
to agree with them? No. They don't own me.""

It's her maiden speech that's worrying her. ""It's a huge thing. And it's all,
'My Lord, my - you can't say 'You.' My 'Fellow Lord'. I don't want to screw up.
I've been reading the manuals and I'm almost done.""

There aren't many famous people who would own up to manual-reading so as to
understand the archaic rules of etiquette in the Lords. I think most would
pretend that they know these things. ""I never, ever, will lose,"" she says, ""and
if I have to work ten times harder and put in more work than that person I will
get past the finish line before them. And that's the way I've always been. And
I'm never going to change. I don't work for the government. I'm doing this for
free off my own back and it's all new to me and I'm out of my comfort zone.""

It's time for me to go. The glamourpuss has relaxed. She's much easier going
than she was two hours ago. It must have been all that fighting talk - you can
see how fired up she gets about success. It's a drive that seems to have a
weirdly relaxing effect on her.

""I would love one day,"" she says, ""for the kids in Peckham and the East End of
Glasgow to say, 'Wow. If we can make it in business we can get in to the House
of Lords, we can get an OBE.' Because I was a complete write-off before I even
started. Just because of where I was from and no education and no money.""

On October 12 she'll doubtless reinvent herself again. Where will it end? ""When
I'm mentoring people,"" she said earlier, ""they start off with, 'Oh, it's my
mum's fault I'm overweight, or my dad's fault I can't get a job.'

I say, 'Stop blaming everyone. You're in charge. If you don't want to be
overweight there's just one way of doing it - cut out the crap and go to the
gym.'"" It's not impossible that David Cameron still has plans for Michelle Mone
- does a job as Tory health or employment minister beckon? n

187884426,"After the UK became the first country in the G7 to adopt the long-standing UN
target to spend 0.7% of GDP on foreign aid, the chancellor was in high spirits.

""We should all take pride in this historic moment for the country,"" said George
Osborne as he delivered his budget statement to MPs.

The government's spending commitment took years of lobbying from charities such
as Christian Aid and Oxfam among others as well as campaign groups like the One
Campaign and the Bond group of NGOs. In an age of countless e-petitions,
publicity campaigns and street protests, it was a rare example of politicians
and NGO staff working together to achieve a common objective.

But how can NGOs lobby governments effectively? How do you get access to
decision-makers? What's the most effective way to contact politicians? How do
you persuade MPs to take up your cause? How do you pester an MP without
irritating them?

And what about the dangers of getting too close to power? Does collaborating
with politicians lead to an inevitable loss of effectiveness?

With just over a month to go before the UK general election, join a team of
experts to discuss how NGOs can get their ideas onto the political agenda on
Thursday 2 April, 1-3pm BST.

187884967,"We are delighted to see that the new intake of MPs means that there are more
women, ethnic minority and lesbian and gay members in the House of Commons than
ever before. We look forward to seeing what business they bring to the attention
of the House. But building representative democracy does not stop here. It is
important that parliament's processes and ways of working also enable the best
possible scrutiny of government.

There is currently a critical gap in these scrutiny arrangements - while select
committees examine the work of most government departments, there is no
mechanism for allowing parliament to examine whether government policy and
practice, and wider activities in both public and private sectors, is the best
it can be to ensure women and minorities have genuinely fair opportunities to
succeed.

Women, ethnic minorities, disabled people and others do not face barriers to
realising their potential in one convenient area of government, but across
employment, health, education, justice and many other areas. We would like to
see a new women and equalities select committee created so that our new MPs have
a place where they can prioritise the assessment of whether government and
others are doing their best to ensure equality for all. Many other parliaments
around the world already have such committees, including the Scottish and
European parliaments.

We hope that Westminster will take the decision to establish such a committee as
soon as is practicable.
